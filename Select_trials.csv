The goal of Phase I is to examine the ability of nifedipine vs. placebo to decrease adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, as well as to begin to assess the dose-dependency of nifedipine effects. The goal of Phase II is to evaluate the long-term effects of nifedipine; that is, can attenuation of ACTH release by nifedipine permit a decrease in the dosage of glucocorticoid needed to suppress the HPA axis?

We will give the vaccines to subjects who have cancer but have not had treatment, and to patients who have had chemotherapy or stem cell transplant. Some patients will get vaccines while they are on treatments which boost the immune system (like the immune stimulating drug interleukin-2 or IL-2). Although we have safely treated many patients with immune boosting drugs, we do not yet know if they improve the body's immune system to respond better to a vaccine. Some healthy volunteers will also be given the vaccines in order to serve as control subjects to get a good measure of the normal immune response. We will compare the patients and the healthy volunteers to study how their immune systems respond to the vaccines.

There are several different types of white cells in the blood. We are interested in immune cells in the blood called T-cells. These T-cells detect foreign substances in the body (like viruses and cancer cells). We are trying to learn more about how the body fights these foreign substances. Our goal is to develop cancer vaccines which would teach T-cells to detect and kill cancer cells better. We know that in healthy people the immune system effectively protects against recurrent virus infection. For example, that is why people only get ""mono"" (mononucleosis) once under normal circumstances. When the body is infected with the ""mono"" virus, the immune system remembers and prevents further infection. We are trying to use the immune system to prevent cancer relapse. To test this, we will give two vaccines which have been used to measure these immune responses. Blood samples will be studied from cancer patients and will be compared to similar samples from normal subjects.","Patients will receive each vaccine once only consisting of:

The next step is to take a small piece of tissue from a human volunteer and see if we can grow a larger piece of tissue from it outside the human body and graft it back into the same person successfully. We expect that this technique will work. It has already been tried in patients with burns of the skin who have had similar procedures where the skin is grafted back to them. The significance of this research is that oral tissue taken from the top of the mouth or palate is in limited supply and leaves the patient with a painful and uncomfortable post surgery experience. If we are successful with our technique the patient will experience less pain and discomfort from the site that we are using to grow our tissue outside the body than if we had taken it from the top of the mouth or palate. In addition, by waiting longer periods to grow the patient's cells we can make larger pieces of oral tissue than we could have gotten directly from the patient's mouth.

430798,NCT00000113,NEI-9,Stony Brook University,OTHER,Correction of Myopia Evaluation Trial (COMET),April 2016,Completed,Stony Brook University,OTHER,"To evaluate whether progressive addition lenses (PALs) slow the rate of progression of juvenile-onset myopia (nearsightedness) when compared with single vision lenses, as measured by cycloplegic autorefraction. An additional outcome measure is axial length, as measured by A-scan ultrasonography.

To describe the natural history of juvenile-onset myopia in a group of children receiving conventional treatment (single vision lenses).","Myopia (nearsightedness) is an important public health problem, which entails substantial societal and personal costs. It is highly prevalent in our society and even more frequent in Asian countries; furthermore, its prevalence may be increasing over time. High myopia contributes to significant loss of vision and blindness. At present, the mechanisms involved in the etiology of myopia are unclear, and there is no way to prevent the condition. Current methods of correction require lifelong use of lenses or surgical treatment, which is expensive and may lead to complications. The rationale for this trial, the Correction of Myopia Evaluation Trial (COMET), arises from the convergence of research involving (1) the link between accommodation and myopia in children and (2) animal models of myopia showing the important role of the visual environment in eye growth. A contribution of this research is that blur is a critical component in the development of myopia. The primary aim of COMET, to evaluate the efficacy of progressive addition lenses, a noninvasive intervention, in slowing the progression of myopia, follows from this line of reasoning. These lenses should provide clear visual input over a range of viewing distances without focusing effort by the child. The comparison of myopia progression in children treated with PALs versus single vision lenses will allow the quantification of the effect of PALs on myopia progression during the followup period.

The COMET is a multicenter, randomized, double-masked clinical trial to evaluate whether PALs slow the progression of juvenile-onset myopia as compared with single vision lenses. The study is a collaborative effort that involves a Study Chair at the New England College of Optometry; four clinical centers at colleges of optometry in Boston, Birmingham, Philadelphia, and Houston; and a Coordinating Center at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

The sample size goal, 450 children with myopia in both eyes who met specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, was attained with the enrollment of 469 children in one year. Children were identified from school screenings, clinic records, and referrals from local practitioners. Eligible children were randomly assigned to receive progressive addition or single vision lenses. Participating children are being examined at 6-month intervals following baseline, for at least 3 years, to measure changes in refractive error and to update prescriptions, according to a specified protocol. A dilated examination to evaluate the study outcome measures is performed at the annual study visits. A standardized, common protocol is used at all centers.

430797,NCT00000114,NEI-10,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,Randomized Trial of Vitamin A and Vitamin E Supplementation for Retinitis Pigmentosa,September 2009,Completed,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,To determine whether supplements of vitamin A or vitamin E alone or in combination affect the course of retinitis pigmentosa.,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited retinal degenerations with a worldwide prevalence of about 1 in 4,000. Patients typically report night blindness in adolescence and lose vision in the midperipheral followed by far-peripheral visual field in adulthood due to progressive loss of both rod and cone function. Most patients have reductions in central vision by age 50 to 80 years. Modern-day electroretinograms (ERGs) make it possible to record retinal responses from most patients with remaining vision and thereby monitor objectively the course of their disease.

While the natural course of retinal degeneration in the common forms of RP was being studied, it was noted that a subgroup of patients aged 18 through 49 who were treating themselves with both vitamin A and vitamin E and other nutritional supplements exhibited less decline in ERG amplitude over a 2-year period. These preliminary findings, as well as the known roles of vitamins A and E in maintaining normal photoreceptor function and structure, prompted this randomized, controlled trial to determine whether these vitamins alone or in combination would halt or slow the progression of the common forms of RP.

This study was a randomized, controlled double-masked trial with 2 x 2 factorial design and duration of 4 to 6 years. Patients were assigned to one of four treatment groups:

15,000 IU/day vitamin A

15,000 IU/day vitamin A + 400 IU/day vitamin E

trace amounts of both vitamins A and E

400 IU/day of vitamin E

430796,NCT00000115,NEI-11,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,Randomized Trial of Acetazolamide for Uveitis-Associated Cystoid Macular Edema,September 2009,Completed,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,To test the efficacy of acetazolamide for the treatment of uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema.,"Uveitis, an intraocular inflammatory disease, is the cause of about 10 percent of visual impairment in the United States. Uveitis may lead to many sight-threatening conditions, including cataract, vitreal opacities, glaucoma, and, most commonly, cystoid macular edema. Reduction of swelling or edema within the retina depends on the movement of fluid from the retina through the choroid. A number of studies indicate that this process requires active transport of fluid ions by the retinal pigment epithelium and may involve the carbonic anhydrase system. Current treatment of uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema requires the use of immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory agents. However, many patients are either resistant or intolerant to this therapy. Recent reports suggested that acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is used to lower intraocular pressure in some glaucoma patients, might be safe and effective in reducing uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema.

Because the course of ocular inflammatory disease can be variable, a double-masked, randomized, crossover trial was designed to test the efficacy of acetazolamide compared with a placebo for the treatment of uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema. Randomized adult patients received either oral acetazolamide sodium 500 mg or a matched placebo every 12 hours for the first 4 weeks of the study. Children 8 years of age or older received a lesser dose based on body weight. Following a 4-week period, during which no medication was given, patients then received a 4-week course of the opposite medication. Primary end points included reduction in cystoid macular edema (graded on fluorescein angiography) and improvement in visual acuity (measured on standardized Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] charts). Laser acuity was also assessed as a secondary outcome variable. Adverse effects of the acetazolamide therapy were monitored by clinical and laboratory examinations.

A total of 40 patients were recruited for the study. Patients were seen at the beginning of the study for baseline measurements and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after enrollment into the study.",Interventional,"Males and females 8 years of age or older and weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) were eligible for the study. Patients had to have a best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or worse in at least one eye with cystoid macular edema demonstrable on fluorescein angiography.

Patients were allowed to receive systemic therapy for their uveitis. Exclusion criteria included current use of acetazolamide as part of a therapeutic regimen; a history of hypersensitivity reactions to acetazolamide, sulfonamides, or angiography dye; unclear ocular media that would obscure fluorescein angiography; macular subretinal neovascularization or a macular hole; or inability to take acetazolamide for medical reasons.",,All,8 Years,,

Patients typically report night blindness and difficulty with midperipheral visual field in adolescence. As the condition progresses, they lose far peripheral visual field. Most patients have reductions in central vision by age 50 to 80 years. Based on electroretinograms (ERGs), the course of the disease can be slowed on average among adults on 15,000 IU/day of vitamin A palmitate. While conducting the trial on the effects of vitamin A on RP, it became apparent that another substance in the diet could be affecting the course of the disease. This prompted the present randomized, controlled trial.

This study is a randomized, controlled, double-masked trial with a planned duration of 5 years. Patients with the common forms of RP are assigned to either a test or a control group. All receive 15,000 IU/day of vitamin A palmitate in addition to the capsules under study.

430794,NCT00000117,NEI-13,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,Intravenous Immunoglobulin Therapy in Optic Neuritis,September 2009,Completed,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,"To determine whether high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is more effective than placebo in restoring lost visual function (visual acuity) in optic neuritis (ON).

To determine the time course of recovery following IVIg administration. If the reports of IVIg-associated clinical improvement occurring within 3 to 6 months following treatment can be confirmed, this would provide indirect evidence that IVIg may promote central nervous system (CNS) remyelination in optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis (MS).","Optic neuritis is the leading cause of transient, spontaneous, reversible visual loss in young adults. Characteristically, patients present with central visual loss that peaks within a few days and is often associated with eye pain. Visual loss may be complete. Spontaneous recovery usually begins within 4 weeks, and marked recovery occurs within 1 to 3 months in most patients. Although clinical improvement is the rule, not all patients recover fully, and many are left with residual symptoms. Although there are limited pathological studies in inflammatory ON, the pathological changes are thought to be virtually identical with those seen in MS, with disruption of the blood-nerve (brain) barrier; primary demyelination with axonal sparing; variable degrees of lymphocytic infiltration; an abundance of macrophages around the inflammatory demyelination lesion; various degrees of remyelination; and, later, oligodendrocyte loss, axonal loss, and gliosis.

Remyelination by oligodendrocytes occurs early in the MS lesion, as documented by myelin sheaths that are abnormally thin relative to axon diameter. These thin myelin sheaths are often seen prominently at the edge of demyelinated plaques. A recent series of studies has shown that within weeks of the initial event, there is extensive oligodendrocyte regeneration and remyelination. These immature oligodendrocytes express a series of developmentally restricted antigens. This finding has been interpreted to suggest that the cells that repopulate the acute plaque and that affect remyelination are newly generated and not residual, mature oligodendrocytes. These observations support the possibility that factors that promote remyelination could be used to improve clinical recovery in ON and MS.

Work at the Mayo Clinic, has shown that both immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed against spinal cord antigens and purified polyclonal mouse IgG administered systemically promote extensive remyelination in SJL mice chronically infected with Theiler's virus. In addition, tissue culture studies suggest that IgG directed against CNS components may promote oligodendroglial proliferation and differentiation. Thus, experimental evidence exists for the concept that immunoglobulins may stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocytes. It is possible that myelin components on the surface of oligodendrocytes could function as receptors or components of receptors. Antibodies could mimic endogenous ligands, thereby inducing the proliferation or differentiation of these cells.

In a preliminary, open-label pilot study of patients with chronic, steroid-unresponsive ON, Drs. van Engelen, Hommes, and colleagues suggested that improvement in visual recovery could be seen following IgG treatment in patients with chronic, stable ON. These encouraging but preliminary basic and clinical studies have prompted us to design a double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial of IVIg in patients with recently acquired but apparently permanent muscle paralysis from MS (NS31506) and to develop this NEI-funded ON study (U10EY1096301).

In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, 60 patients were assigned to receive either IVIg or a placebo over a period of 3 months. In order to be eligible, patients who meet the inclusion criteria needed to have a stable loss of visual function (unchanged between the pre-enrollment screening visit and the enrollment visit). All patients wre re-examined at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, with the primary outcome being the impact of treatment on visual acuity at 6 months as determined by measurements on a retroilluminated Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart at 4 meters.

One group of patients received 0.4 g/kg Gammimmune N intravenously daily for 5 days, and thereafter once a month for 3 months (total: eight infusions).

At present, ganciclovir and foscarnet are the only drugs that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CMV retinitis. The therapeutic regimen for each drug consists of a 2-week induction period followed by daily maintenance intravenous infusions. Unfortunately, CMV retinitis usually progresses despite daily maintenance therapy, and both drugs are associated with significant systemic toxicity that often limits their therapeutic usefulness. As an alternative to intravenous administration, direct intravitreal injections of ganciclovir have been studied and have been shown to be effective in delaying the progression of CMV retinitis. The short half-life of the drug, however, necessitates one to two intraocular injections a week to maintain therapeutic levels. Widespread adoption of this technique has been limited because of the logistical difficulties and inherent risks associated with numerous intravitreal injections.

A drug delivery system capable of continuous delivery of ganciclovir into the vitreous cavity has been developed. The device consists of a 6-mg pellet of ganciclovir that is coated with a series of polymers with variable permeability to ganciclovir. The device is surgically implanted through the pars plana.

Thirty eyes of 26 patients with unilateral non-sight-threatening CMV retinitis were randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) immediate therapy with a device designed to release ganciclovir into the vitreous cavity a over approximately a 4-month period or (2) deferred treatment. In patients with bilateral non-sight-threatening CMV retinitis, one eye was randomly assigned to receive a ganciclovir implant with the other eye assigned to deferred treatment. (Note: The original trial design included a third randomized arm using a 2 ug/hour device. This arm was dropped for logistical reasons after enrolling two patients.)

Patients assigned to immediate treatment underwent surgery to implant the ganciclovir device within 48 hours of enrollment and baseline photographs. Postoperatively, patients were evaluated the next day, weekly for 2 weeks, and then every 2 weeks until progression of CMV retinitis occurred. At each examination, in both eyes, visual acuity with current correction and best correction was determined using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study eye charts; intraocular pressure was determined; evidence of inflammation or cataract was evaluated; and all retinal findings were documented. Any adverse event considered even possibly related to the device or to the implantation procedure was documented. Standardized nine-field fundus photographs were taken at each 2-week visit. The ganciclovir implant was exchanged at 32 weeks or earlier if progression of CMV retinitis occurred.

The primary end point was time to CMV retinitis progression, defined as the time (days) from initiating therapy until the advancement of 750-um over a 750 um front of any border of any lesion was observed. Standardized nine-field photographs were taken at 2-week intervals and analyzed in a masked fashion by the Fundus Photograph Reading Center to determine evidence of CMV retinitis progression.

Secondary end points included time to development of CMV retinitis in the contralateral eye, time to development of visceral CMV, and time to death.",Interventional,"All patients must have had AIDS as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and non-sight-threatening CMV retinitis Patients could not have been previously treated with systemic ganciclovir or foscarnet and must not have had evidence of other organ involvement with CMV.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraocular lens implantation in patients with severe uveitis.","Patients with uveitis are at high risk for significant complications following cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation. Complications may result from the surgery itself or may develop after surgery as a result of the intraocular lens. Complications related to intraocular lens implantation include iris adhesions to the intraocular lens, which can result in lens capture; cellular deposits on the surface of the lens that can obscure vision; and uveitis. Recent studies have identified giant cells on the anterior surface of intraocular lenses in some patients with uveitis, appearing to indicate an intraocular lens-induced inflammatory response. Some of these patients have required multiple YAG laser procedures to remove these deposits.

Modification of the surface of the intraocular lens with a layer of heparin may provide a more biocompatible surface. Preclinical studies have shown a reduction in the degree of postoperative complications with the heparin surface-modified intraocular lens compared with an unmodified lens. Although retrospective case series have examined the use of heparin surface-modified intraocular lenses in patients with uveitis, a randomized, controlled clinical trial has not been performed.

This is a randomized clinical trial examining the safety and efficacy of the heparin surface-modified intraocular lens in patients with uveitis. Eighty patients with a history of uveitis in an eye requiring cataract surgery will be randomized to receive a heparin surface-modified intraocular lens or the same model of intraocular lens without surface modification. The primary end point of the study will be the development of cellular deposits on the anterior surface of the intraocular lens 1 year after surgery. These cellular deposits will be assessed by a masked grader using standard photographs. Secondary end points will include visual acuity, intraocular inflammation, development of anterior and posterior synechiae, and corneal endothelial cell counts.",Interventional,"Women and men 18 years or older with a documented history of uveitis in an eye requiring cataract surgery are eligible for the study.

To compare side effects of the two prophylactic agents.","Sexually transmitted diseases are a major cause of neonatal eye infections. All 50 States require some eye treatment at birth to prevent gonorrheal eye infections. Approximately 3 to 4 million Americans acquire a genital chlamydial infection each year, and more than 150,000 infants are born to mothers with chlamydial infections. These infants are at high risk of developing conjunctivitis and pneumonia.

In the State of Washington, one of three treatments is presently required by law to help prevent gonorrheal eye infection in newborn babies: 1 percent silver nitrate drops, erythromycin ointment, or tetracycline ointment. Although all three treatments appear to prevent eye infections from gonorrhea, silver nitrate and erythromycin may also partially prevent chlamydial conjunctivitis. However, silver nitrate may irritate and damage the eyes of newborns.

If it is not known whether the mother is infected, it may be better not to give the drugs routinely. It could not be clearly established from the medical literature whether the risk to infants from no treatment was higher or lower than the risk from receiving a prophylactic agent. Many parents at low risk for gonorrhea prefer that no prophylaxis be given to their newborns. Moreover, Great Britain, which used no eye prophylactic agents for newborns for the 25 years preceding the study, has rates of neonatal conjunctivitis similar to those in the United States. For these reasons, the Washington State Board of Health granted this study an exemption from the State law to allow the investigators to evaluate scientifically the risks and benefits of no treatment.

The study was a randomized, double-masked clinical trials planned to include 1,200 infants born over 3 years. The trial compared the efficacy of two treatment regimens (silver nitrate and erythromycin) in two treatment groups to the outcomes in a control group receiving no prophylaxis. (Erythromycin was chosen over tetracycline as the antibiotic in this study because it is more commonly used in the United States for ocular prophylaxis.)

Women were recruited from the University of Washington Medical Center-associated obstetric units. Among the 2,577 women eligible for possible participation, 758 enrolled. Of these participants, 89 were not randomized. Among the 669 randomized women, 39 were not available for personal observation. These 39 were equally distributed among the three prophylaxis groups. In the final participant group, the infants of 630 women were evaluable.

The infants were randomly assigned to one of these three groups in the delivery room. Infants without conjunctivitis were monitored for 2 months after delivery. Infants who developed conjunctivitis were monitored for 2 months after successful treatment of their infection. The study included extensive efforts to determine the etiology of the conjunctivitis and to find nasolacrimal duct obstruction.",Interventional,"The study included male and female infants delivered at University Hospital in Seattle, Washington. Women were recruited after the 28th week of pregnancy and had to be English-speaking. In addition, they planned to stay at the hospital at least 48 hours following delivery and lived in the greater Seattle metropolitan area. Infants were eligible whether they were delivered vaginally or by cesarean section.

To determine whether patients who respond to prism adaptation by developing a new stable angle of -deviation have a better surgical result than do patients who do not respond to prism adaptation.

To determine whether patients who respond to prism adaptation are more accurately corrected by operating for the prism-adapted angle or the original angle of deviation.

To determine the usefulness of certain input variables (e.g., age at the time of surgery, size of the deviation, visual acuity, binocular function, refractive error) in predicting which patients are more likely to benefit from prism adaptation.","Acquired esotropia (crossed eyes that develop after a child reaches the age of 6 months) accounts for 25 percent of all patients with misaligned eyes. Surgery to correct esotropia is done primarily to attain functional use of the two eyes together. The cosmetic aspect of the surgery is secondary. In 40 to 50 percent of cases, more than one operation is needed to accomplish the primary goal, and in some cases even three and four operations are needed.

Preliminary studies from two eye care centers reported that the use of prisms on eyeglasses for about a month before surgery led to good results after a single operation in more than 90 percent of patients. These uncontrolled preliminary studies pointed to the need for a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial designed to prove or disprove scientifically the beneficial effect of prisms.

The Prism Adaptation Study was a double randomization trial involving 286 patients. Three-fifths of the patients were randomly selected for prism adaptation before surgery. Of the patients who responded to the prisms, one-half were randomly selected to have surgery based on the amount of prism required to stabilize the deviation, and the other half had surgery based on the amount of esotropia originally measured. Patients who did not respond to the prisms also had surgery based on the amount of esotropia measured, as did the two-fifths of the patients who did not undergo prism adaptation.

Patients were examined postoperatively at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. An independent examiner, masked to the treatment assignment, evaluated the patient at the 6-month followup. The results were analyzed to determine whether the outcome was better in patients who underwent prism adaptation or in those who underwent conventional treatment. Because the examiner did not know what type of treatment a patient had received, he or she would have no bias in evaluating the results.",Interventional,"An eligible male or female must have been age 3 years or older (adults were included) and must have had esotropia that occurred at age 6 months or older, with no history of previous eye muscle surgery.",,All,3 Years,,

However, the prognosis is less favorable for aphakic patients with glaucoma or glaucoma in phakic eyes following unsuccessful filtering operations. Failure of filtering surgery is usually attributed to the proliferation of fibroblasts at the filtering site. The use of 5-FU, an antimetabolite, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of fibroblasts in tissue culture, and in preliminary studies it has increased the success of filtering surgery in a nonhuman primate model.

The Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study (FFSS) was a randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing the success rate of standard glaucoma filtering surgery to the success rate of standard surgery with adjunctive 5-FU treatment.

Another element of this study was to evaluate the frequency and severity of possible adverse effects related to 5-FU injections. Detailed preoperative and postoperative examinations of the cornea, lens, and retina were performed. Systemic toxicity was assessed by preoperative and postoperative hematologic studies.

After the investigators performed the filtering surgery and determined that the new outlet channel was working, patients were randomized to receive either 5-FU injections or standard postsurgical care without 5-FU. The patients treated with 5-FU received subconjunctival injections of 5 mg of 5-FU twice daily on postoperative days 1 through 7 and once daily on postoperative days 8 through 14. There were 213 patients recruited into the study, 162 with previous cataract extraction and 51 with previous filtering surgery.

All patients were examined at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 18 months, and 2 years postoperatively and at yearly intervals thereafter until 5 years postoperatively. Possible concomitant risks of 5-FU treatment, such as toxic effects to the cornea, lens, or retina, were monitored.",Interventional,Men and women with uncontrolled intraocular pressure greater than 21 mm Hg in one or both eyes despite maximal tolerated therapy and who were aphakic or had undergone previous filtering surgery were eligible to participate.,No,All,,,

To study the mechanisms by which refractive error and visual acuity changes occur, in particular the contribution that comes from changes in corneal curvature and shape.

To determine whether there were any predisposing ocular factors that could be used to predict which subjects will experience changes or complications.","In the early 1960s, a group of clinicians asserted that myopia could be reduced and possibly corrected by fitting specially designed contact lenses to induce corneal flattening and thereby reduce the refractive power of the eye. This technique, known as orthokeratology, required that the lenses be fitted and then changed progressively until vision becomes normal or nearly normal. Advocates of orthokeratology claimed that corneal changes could be induced in a predictable fashion, were often permanent, and occurred without causing any adverse effects to the cornea. Data on orthokeratology were generally limited, poorly documented, and did not address the issues of control or failure.

The Berkeley Orthokeratology Study was a single center randomized, concurrently controlled, masked clinical trial. Corneal and visual changes in an orthokeratology treatment group were monitored and compared with those observed in a control group whose members wore contact lenses fitted in a standard clinical manner. Visual and ocular characteristics were monitored for 1.5 years.

Eighty subjects were studied-40 in an orthokeratology group and 40 in a control group fitted with conventional hard contact lenses. The hard lenses chosen for this study were made of either polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or a PMMA-silicone combination (Polycon). All subjects were initially fitted with PMMA lenses.

The initial treatment and control lenses were selected according to protocol guidelines and then adjusted to achieve an ""optimal fit"" based on lens position, movement, and alignment as assessed by fluorescein study. At the outset, the treatment and control lenses differed in that the treatment lenses were on the average thicker and flatter and had a larger diameter.

Following the dispensing visit, subjects progressed through three study phases. In the adaption phase (Phase A), subjects were examined weekly until they were adapted to 12 to 14 hours of daily contact lens wear. The postadaptive phase (Phase B) consisted of monthly followup examinations for 1 year.

To determine which of two standard treatments, removal of the eye or brachytherapy, is more likely to prolong survival of eligible patients with medium-sized choroidal melanoma.

To determine whether preoperative radiation prolongs life for patients whose eyes with large choroidal melanoma are enucleated.","For more than 100 years, removal of the eye (enucleation) has been the standard treatment for choroidal melanoma. Before the COMS was initiated in 1986, interest in radiation therapy had increased because of the potential for saving the eye and perhaps some vision. However, the merits of radiation with respect to prolonging patient survival were unknown. The best data from nonrandomized studies suggested that there was no difference in length of remaining life between patients treated with radiation and those whose eyes were enucleated. Thus, it was appropriate and necessary to conduct a randomized, controlled clinical trial in which a large number of patients would be followed for many years in order to compare enucleation and radiation with respect to relative success in prolonging survival of choroidal melanoma patients.

The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) is a set of long-term, multicenter, randomized controlled trials. In the trial for patients with tumors of medium size, enucleation and irradiation with an iodine-125 episcleral plaque are compared on the basis of length of remaining life. All randomized patients will be followed for 5 to 15 years or until death. For patients randomly assigned to enucleation, the eye was removed following a standard procedure. For patients assigned to plaque irradiation, the margins of the tumor were located and the dimensions of the tumor were measured by the ophthalmic surgeon. A gold plaque with a plastic seed carrier that contained the proper dosage and configuration of radioactive iodine seeds was sutured to the outside (sclera) of the eye over the base of the tumor. This procedure made possible the delivery of a high dose of radiation to a very localized area (85 Gy [TG-43] to the tumor apex). The plaque typically was removed from the eye after three to seven days. Enrollment was completed in this trial in July 1998 with 1,317 patients enrolled. Clinical follow-up of patients will end in July 2003.

In the COMS trial of preoperative radiation, patients with large tumors were randomized to enucleation alone or to enucleation preceded by 20 Gy of external beam radiation. The two randomly assigned groups of patients were followed for at least five years or until death and have been compared on the basis of length of remaining life and other outcomes. Enrollment in this trial was completed in December 1994, with 1,003 patients enrolled. Clinical follow-up of all patients in this trial ended in July 2000.

Accrual to a nonrandomized pilot study to assess the feasibility of a randomized trial for small tumors was halted in 1989. Additional followup of those 204 patients was carried out from 1994 to 1996.

The COMS is conducted in 43 clinical centers located in major population areas of the United States and Canada. Six resource centers participate and have major roles in quality assurance for the study. Information gathered and analyzed includes time to death from all causes, time to death from cancer (whether metastatic choroidal melanoma or not), diagnosis of other tumors, complications of radiation, and changes in visual acuity. A parallel study of quality of life for patients enrolled in the trial of radioactive plaque was initiated in January 1995.

To quantify risk factors for developing open-angle glaucoma among ocular hypertensive individuals.","OHTS Phase 3 will re-examine study participants 20 plus years after enrollment to document clinical status and the incidence and severity of self-reported functional limitations. The 279 participants who developed POAG in OHTS Phase 1 or 2 will have more than 10 years of post-POAG follow-up by Phase 3. The timing of re-examination at 20 years is meaningful because 20 years approaches the median life expectancy of OHT patients in their 60's and 70's and half the median life expectancy of patients in their 40's and 50's. For the first time, patients with ocular hypertension and clinicians will have high quality data about the long-term risk of developing POAG and functional limitations associated with the disease. These data will facilitate patient-centered care so that patients and clinicians can decide on the appropriate frequency of tests and examinations and the potential benefit of preventative treatment.

Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States and other industrialized countries. It is estimated that 2 million people in the United States have glaucoma and that 80,000 of these individuals are legally blind from the disease. Among African Americans, glaucoma is now recognized as the leading cause of blindness.

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), a common condition affecting 3 to 6 million people in the United States, is thought to be the leading risk factor for development of open-angle glaucoma. There is no consensus that medical reduction of intraocular pressure prevents or delays the onset of visual field and/or optic nerve damage in ocular hypertensive subjects.

Despite the lack of convincing evidence for the efficacy of medical treatment in ocular hypertension, approximately 1.5 million glaucoma suspects in the United States are being treated with costly ocular hypotensive medications that carry the potential for serious and even life-threatening side effects.

Clearly, there is a need for a well-controlled clinical trial to determine whether medical reduction of IOP can prevent or delay the onset of glaucomatous damage in ocular hypertensive subjects. Only then can clinicians and patients make rational choices and health care planners ensure that limited medical resources are being allocated in a safe and cost-effective manner.

The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) is a long-term, randomized, controlled multicenter clinical trial. Ocular hypertensive subjects judged to be at moderate risk of developing primary open-angle glaucoma are randomly assigned to either close observation only or a stepped medical regimen. Medical treatment consists of all commercially available topical ocular hypotensive eye drops.

After completion of baseline measures (IOP, visual fields, disc photos) and randomization, the subjects are followed for a minimum of 5 years with automated threshold central static perimetry (Humphrey program 30-2) twice yearly and stereoscopic optic disc photographs once yearly. Study end points are reproducible visual field loss and/or progressive optic disc damage in either eye of a patient attributed to glaucoma by a Masked Endpoint Committee. All visual fields and optic disc photographs are read in a masked fashion in Reading Centers.

In the 1991 Baltimore Eye Survey, African Americans were shown to have a prevalence of open-angle glaucoma four to five times higher than whites. Given this high prevalence of glaucoma in the African American population, it is important to recruit and follow an adequate sample of African American subjects in the trial (approximately 25 percent of the total patient sample).

No proven treatment currently exists to reverse or arrest this loss. There is no accepted method for the prevention or reduction of the likelihood of second eye involvement. NAION strikes both eyes in as many as 40 percent of affected patients (Beri et al. 1987), with a 2-year risk of about 25 percent (Steven Feldon, personal communication to SEK).

IONDT compared optic nerve decompression surgery (ONDS), which was becoming a widely used treatment for NAION, with careful followup alone, in patients with newly diagnosed NAION. The rationale for the surgery was that NAION was caused by impaired blood flow to the optic nerve and that decompression surgery would restore vision by alleviating pressure surrounding the nerve. Because ONDS was fast becoming the standard of care, evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the procedure was tested in the context of a randomized clinical trial.

Within 2 years of the start of the IONDT, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended cessation of the clinical trial recruitment. The National Institutes of Health issued a clinical alert to 25,000 ophthalmologists and neurologists describing the study findings that surgery was no better than careful followup and may be harmful (IONDT 1995). It was recommended that ONDS not be used in cases of NAION. Thus, the IONDT findings not only have led to a costly and ineffective surgery to be abandoned as a treatment for NAION, but also have left practitioners with a dearth of treatment choices.

The IONDT is the first multicenter, prospective study of newly diagnosed patients with NAION. The baseline history and examination, which took place within 14 days of the onset of symptoms, used standardized methods and diagnostic criteria to collect data on all factors possibly relating to the etiology of NAION. In reports from previous studies that present data on both initial and final visual acuities, no data are available regarding change in visual acuity over time for individual patients. Where data are available on final visual acuity, reported rates of improvement are low, ranging from 0 percent to 33 percent for untreated eyes. The IONDT found, however, an improvement of three or more lines in 42.7 percent of patients who received careful followup.

NAION in both eyes has been reported in as few as 10.5 percent and as many as 73 percent of patients. In a study of bilateral NAION where all patients were prospectively logged, Beri et al. reported that 17.5 percent of patients developed bilateral disease at 1 year of followup and 34.5 percent developed it at 5 years. However, Beck et al., using a life table analysis on the same cohort reported by Beri et al., estimated the risk of bilateral NAION to be 12 percent within 2 years and 19 percent within 5 years. The IONDT has so far similarly reported a 12 percent (25/216) incidence of bilateral NAION in its randomized patients. The incidence in the nonrandomized group, 91 percent of whom had visual acuity better than 20/64, is much lower at 4 percent (5/136).

Thus, continued followup of the IONDT cohort is critically important to ascertain a clear picture of the natural history of NAION in terms of involvement of the second eye and long-term vision. Data obtained will be critical in understanding the etiology of the disease and in generating hypotheses for testing further treatments for the disease.

The IONDT Followup Study will continue to monitor vision and other health outcomes in patients originally enrolled in the IONDT, whether randomized to one of the two treatment groups or whether followed as part of the natural history cohort. All IONDT patients were diagnosed with NAION within 14 days of onset of symptoms, have had a minimum of 2 years of continuous followup, and will be followed for an additional 4 years in the Followup Study. Patients will have annual visits at the original IONDT Clinical Center or, if necessary, with a surrogate provider. If NAION occurs in the second eye, the patient will be asked to visit the clinic for a special visit. The Coordinating Center will telephone the patients on a quarterly basis, between annual visits. Outcomes that will be examined include:

incidence of NAION in the second eye,
medical or ocular events surrounding the occurrence of NAION,

430784,NCT00000127,NEI-26,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial (IONDT),September 2009,Completed,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,To assess the safety and efficacy of optic nerve sheath decompression surgery for non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).,"Non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), the most common cause of acute optic nerve disease in older persons, causes permanent and severe visual loss. Visual function can be impaired through decreased central visual acuity or peripheral field loss, or both. NAION strikes both eyes in up to 40 percent of affected patients. The incidence of NAION has been estimated at 2.3 per 100,000 persons over the age of 50 years and 0.54 per 100,000 for all ages. Estimates of the number of new cases seen each year in the United States range from a low of approximately 1,500 to a high of 6,000.

NAION has been hypothesized to be caused by vascular insufficiency leading to optic nerve head ischemia. There is general agreement that NAION results from transient non-perfusion of nutrient vessels. The wide range of visual field defects and visual loss with NAION can be explained by the extent and number of the blood vessels involved.

Anatomical factors appear to contribute to the vascular event initiating NAION. Clinically, the number of discs congenitally lacking a physiological cup in eyes with NAION is higher than expected. Presumably, in eyes with NAION, these discs have small scleral openings that crowd the nerve fibers as they pass through the restricted space in the optic disc and lamina cribrosa, thereby predisposing to an ischemic spiral.

One current theory holds that NAION begins as a minor ischemic event that later progresses to a major infarction due to congenitally anomalous optic nerves. The inciting ischemic event leads to local anterior nerve edema, and this causes further ischemia.

Optic nerve sheath decompression surgery was reported in 1989 to be of benefit to patients with NAION. The presumed mechanism of action in optic nerve decompression surgery revolved around restoration of impaired blood flow to the optic nerve through reduction of the pressure around the nerve.

The Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial (IONDT) was a randomized clinical trial designed to compare the improvements in visual acuity at 6 months in patients assigned to receive surgery with optic nerve sheath decompression with those assigned to careful followup. A cohort of patients, with a baseline visual acuity of better than 20/64 are also being followed to better understand the natural history of the disease, including second eye involvement.

Enrollment began in October 1992. Randomization was stratified by clinic, and patients had an equal probability of assignment to surgery or careful followup. All patients are being followed for a minimum of 2 years.

The primary outcome is a change of three lines or more in visual acuity at the 6-month followup visit compared with visual acuity measured at the randomization visit.

Secondary outcomes include a change in visual acuity beyond 6 months, change in peripheral visual function as measured by automated Humphrey perimetry, local and systemic side effects from treatment, change in quality of life, and other associated morbidity and mortality.",Interventional,"Men and women age 50 years or older, with acute NAION and visual symptoms for 14 days or less since the onset of symptoms, and visual acuity worse than or equal to 20/64 were eligible for randomization.",No,All,50 Years,,
430783,NCT00000128,NEI-27,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,A Trial of Bifocals in Myopic Children With Esophoria,June 2002,Unknown status,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,To test the hypothesis that correction with bifocal spectacle lenses rather than single-vision lenses will slow the progression of myopia in children with near-point esophoria. The primary outcome variable is cycloplegic refraction as measured with an automated refractor. Axial length is measured with ultrasound in order to test the corollary hypothesis that use of bifocals will slow ocular growth in these myopic children. We will also examine the amount of close work performed by subjects and the degree of parental myopia as factors that may influence myopia progression.,"About 25 percent of all persons in the United States are myopic. The most common form of myopia is childhood myopia, which begins after age 6 and progresses rapidly until age 16. Myopia progression results from excessive growth of the eye, primarily by enlargement of the vitreous chamber. Excessive elongation of the eye is a major risk factor for retinal detachment.

Previous prospective studies failed to show that use of bifocals was effective in slowing myopia progression. However, these studies did not separate subjects by near-point phoria before randomization. Retrospective studies by David Goss indicated that bifocals slowed myopia progression by almost 50 percent in children with near-point esophoria but had no effect on children with exophoria.

A small, prospective pilot study, completed by the investigators of this trial, also supported the hypothesis that bifocals slow myopia progression in children with near-point esophoria. Thirty-two myopic children, all of whom showed near-point esophoria, were enrolled in this 18-month study. Twenty-eight children completed the study, with 14 randomized into bifocals and 14 into single-vision lenses. Cycloplegic automated refraction was performed every 6 months. Over the course of the whole study, there was a small, statistically insignificant difference in the rates of myopia progression: 0.57 diopters per year (D/yr) (S.E. = 0.11) for those in single-vision lenses compared with 0.36 D/yr (S.E. = 0.12) for those in bifocals (p = 0.26).

However, significant seasonal effects in myopia progression were demonstrated, and the results also suggested that the beneficial effects of bifocals may take several months to develop. During the first 6 months, which included most of the school year, myopia progression was rapid in both the bifocal group (0.61 D/yr) and the single-vision group (0.68 D/yr). During the second 6 months, which included all of the summer vacation, myopia progression was slow in both groups, 0.32 and 0.26 D/yr for bifocal wearers and single-vision wearers, respectively. During the last 6 months, i.e., the second school year, myopia progressed slowly in the bifocal wearers (0.37 D/yr) but rapidly (0.80 D/yr) in single-vision wearers. A repeated-measure analysis of variance demonstrated a significant seasonal effect (p < 0.002) and a significant interaction between season and type of correction (p < 0.043).

The apparent effectiveness of bifocals in children with near-point esophoria and the lack of effectiveness in other children may be explained by a greater lag of accommodation in children with esophoria. This lag might cause a slightly blurred retinal image that the bifocal may sharpen. Other mechanisms might also be involved.

Eighty or more myopic children, all with near-point esophoria as measured at baseline with von Graefe prisms through a current myopic correction placed in a phoropter, will be randomly assigned to wear either single-vision spectacle lenses or lenses with +1.50 D add in a flat-top 28-mm segment. Subjects will visit one of two sites, either a private optometry practice in Tulsa or the optometry clinic at Northeastern State University, every 6 months. Data collected at each visit will include automated refraction after cycloplegia with 1 percent tropicamide, biometry with A-scan, and estimates of the amount of study and other close work by means of questionnaires administered to the subjects and their parents. We will also obtain measures of the degree of myopia in the biological parents. The myopic correction will be changed if the spherical component of the refraction in either eye has changed by 0.5 diopter or more or if any change in cylinder power or axis improves vision in either eye by three letters or more. The study will continue for 30 months and will include six visits by each subject.",Interventional,"Boys must have been between 6 and 12 years of age; girls between 6 and 11 years of age. All children must have had at least 0.5 diopters of myopia in both eyes, near-point esophoria, at least 20/25 acuity in each eye, and 40 seconds of stereopsis and must have been free of ocular disease or systemic disease that may have altered refraction.

To detect complications of the surgery.

To discover patient characteristics and surgical factors affecting the results.

To determine the long-term safety and efficacy of the procedure.","Approximately 11 million Americans have myopia that can be corrected with eyeglasses or contact lenses. Some of these people may also be candidates for radial keratotomy (RK), a procedure that aims to correct or reduce myopia by surgery that flattens the corneal curvature.

Keratotomy was first performed by surgeons in Europe and the United States in the late 1800s, and the basic optical and mechanical principles of the operation were defined in the 1940s and 1950s by the Japanese doctors T. Sato and K. Akiyama, who used anterior and posterior corneal incisions. The posterior incisions damaged the cornea, and the procedure was modified in the Soviet Union by doctors Fyodorov and V. Durnev to include incisions in only the anterior cornea. Since its introduction into the United States in 1978, numerous ophthalmologists have modified the procedure by introducing technical and surgical improvements such as ultrasonic methods to measure the thickness of the cornea and the use of diamond-bladed micrometer knives to make the incisions.

However, scientific assessment of RK lagged behind growing public and professional interest in the procedure. In 1980, in response to widespread concern about the long-term safety and efficacy of RK, a group of ophthalmic surgeons approached the National Eye Institute with a proposal for a multicenter clinical trial that would evaluate the potential benefits and risks of this procedure.

The Prospective Evaluation of Radial Keratotomy study, involving 435 patients and 99 pilot patients, was a clinical trial designed to evaluate the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of one technique of radial keratotomy. The procedure was evaluated by comparing a patient's refractive error and uncorrected vision before and after surgery. The more myopic eye received surgery first. Patients were required to wait 1 year before having the operation on the second eye.

The surgical technique was standardized, consisting of eight centrifugal radial incisions made manually with a diamond micrometer knife. The diameter of the central, uncut, clear zone was determined by the preoperative spherical equivalent cycloplegic refraction (-2.00 to -3.12 D = 4.0 mm; -3.25 to -4.3 D = 3.5 mm; -4.50 to -8.00 D = 3.0 mm). The blade length, which determined the depth of the incision, was set at 100 percent of the thinnest of four intraoperative ultrasonic corneal thickness readings taken paracentrally at the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-o'clock meridians just outside the mark delineating the clear zone. The incisions were made from the edge of the trephine mark to the limbal vascular arcade and were spaced equidistantly around the cornea.

Patients were examined preoperatively and after surgery at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, annually for 5 years, and at 10 years. Examinations in the morning and evening of the same day were done at 3 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 11 years in a subset of the patients to test for diurnal fluctuation of vision and refraction.

The primary outcome variables measured at each visit was the uncorrected and spectacle-corrected visual acuity and the refractive error with the pupil dilated and undilated. The corneal shape was measured with central keratometry and photokeratoscopy. Endothelial function was evaluated using specular microscopy. A slit-lamp microscope examination was made to check for complications from the incisions. Contrast sensitivity was tested in a subset of patients. Patient motivation and satisfaction were studied with psychometric questionnaires at baseline, 1 year, 5-6 years, and 10 years.",Interventional,All men and women had 2 to 8 diopters of simple myopia and were correctable to 20/20 or better with glasses or contact lenses.

To determine the role of intravenous antibiotics in the management of bacterial endophthalmitis.

To determine which factors, other than treatment, predict outcome in postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis.","Endophthalmitis is a serious ocular infection that can result in blindness. Approximately 70 percent of cases occur as a direct complication of intraocular surgery. Current management requires culture of intraocular contents and administration of an antibiotic. Vitrectomy surgery, which may help to manage endophthalmitis by removing infecting organisms and their toxins, has been shown to be of value in various animal models of endophthalmitis. However, human studies have not shown an advantage to vitrectomy with intraocular antibiotics compared with intraocular antibiotics alone.

In all large comparison studies to date, eyes with the worst initial presentations were the ones selected for vitrectomy. Because of the selection bias involved in determining which cases received vitrectomy, existing clinical information on the efficacy of the procedure for treating endophthalmitis is inconclusive. Determining the role of initial vitrectomy and the benefit or lack of benefit to certain subgroups of patients will help the clinician in the management of endophthalmitis.

In addition, although systemic antibiotics have long been used in the management of endophthalmitis, there has been little evidence to support their efficacy, but there have been many reports of toxic systemic effects. In view of this, the role of systemic antibiotics in the management of endophthalmitis will be assessed.

Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study (EVS) patients were randomized to one of two standard treatment strategies for the management of bacterial endophthalmitis. Eyes received either (1) initial pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics, followed by retap and reinjection at 36-60 hours for eyes that did poorly as defined in the study or (2) initial anterior chamber and vitreous tap/biopsy with injection of intravitreal antibiotics, followed by vitrectomy and reinjection at 36-60 hours in eyes doing poorly. In addition, all eyes were randomized to either treatment or no treatment with intravenous antibiotics.

Study end points were visual acuity and clarity of ocular media, the latter assessed both clinically and photographically. Each patient's initial end point assessment occurred at 3 months, after which procedures to improve vision, such as late vitrectomy for nonclearing ocular media, were an option. The final outcome assessment occurred at 9 months. Multiple centers cooperated by enrolling 420 eyes during the 42-month recruitment period.",Interventional,"Men and women were eligible for entry into the EVS if they had clinical signs and symptoms of bacterial endophthalmitis in an eye that had cataract surgery or lens implantation within 6 weeks of onset of infection. The involved eye had to have either hypopyon or enough clouding of anterior chamber or vitreous media to obscure clear visualization of second-order arterioles, a cornea and anterior chamber in the involved eye clear enough to visualize some part of the iris, and a cornea clear enough to allow the possibility of pars plana vitrectomy. The eyes had to have a visual acuity of 20/50 or worse and light perception or better.

Patients were ineligible when the involved eye was known at the time of study entry to have had any pre-existing eye disease that limited best-corrected visual acuity to 20/100 or worse before development of cataract, any intraocular surgery before presentation (except for cataract extraction or lens implantation), any treatment for endophthalmitis before presenting at the study center, or any ocular or systemic condition that would prevent randomization to any of the study groups.",No,All,,,

To assess whether grid-pattern photocoagulation therapy will reduce loss of central visual acuity due to macular edema secondary to CVO.

To develop new data describing the course and prognosis for eyes with CVO.","Central vein occlusion is a common retinal vascular disorder with potentially blinding complications. The two major complications are reduced central vision caused by macular edema and neovascular glaucoma caused by iris neovascularization. Other clinical trials have shown that laser photocoagulation is an effective treatment for complications found in diabetic retinopathy and branch vein occlusion, which have some features in common with CVO: neovascularization and reduced visual acuity caused by macular edema occur in all three disorders. Evidence from small-scale studies suggests that a grid pattern of photocoagulation reduces macular edema in CVO patients, although the associated changes in visual acuity are variable. The CVOS is a detailed investigation of grid pattern photocoagulation in a larger randomized group of patients.

Eligible patients were divided into four groups:

Group N: Eyes with extensive retinal ischemia (at least 10 disc areas of nonperfusion) were randomly assigned to receive panretinal photocoagulation or nontreatment unless iris neovascularization developed.

Group M: Eyes with visual loss ascribable to macular edema were randomly assigned to receive grid-pattern photocoagulation or nontreatment.

Group P: Eyes with relatively perfused retinas were followed to provide information about the natural history of the disease.

Group I: Indeterminate eyes in which the retina could not be visualized accurately because of hemorrhage were followed in a natural history study.

Green argon laser with a slit lamp delivery system was used for all treatments.

The secondary purposes are to determine the extent of IOP reduction attained by treatment, to explore factors that may influence glaucoma progression, and to describe the natural history of newly detected glaucoma.","Glaucoma is a common disease in older adults. All present treatment aims at reduction of the intraocular pressure, but indications for therapy are not well defined. Furthermore, it is unclear whether intraocular pressure influences the natural history of glaucoma. Against this background, the primary aim of the study is of central importance to patients with manifest and suspect glaucoma.

Glaucoma has few subjective symptoms during a long period early in the disease, but damage is irreversible once it occurs. Early diagnosis and rapid detection of progression are of paramount importance in limiting this damage, whether through pressure reduction or in some other way. The effectiveness, if any, of lowering the intraocular pressure in glaucoma requires evaluation by controlled treatment trials.

The Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT) is the first large, controlled, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of lowering the intraocular pressure on the progression of newly detected, open-angle glaucoma. This study will compare glaucoma progression in initially treated versus untreated patients with newly detected open-angle glaucoma and will allow quantification of the effect of immediate IOP-lowering treatment on progression during the followup period.

The EMGT is a collaborative effort that involves a Clinical Center at the Department of Ophthalmology of Malmo University Hospital at the University of Lund, Sweden, and its Satellite Center in Helsingborg, Sweden; an independent Data Center at the Department of Preventive Medicine, University Medical Center at Stony Brook, New York; and a Disc Photography Reading Center at the Department of Ophthalmology in Lund at the University of Lund. The study was initiated with support from the Swedish Medical Research Council.

Recruitment for the study has been completed. The 255 patients were identified by an extensive, population-based screening of successive age cohorts as well as by clinical referral. The diagnosis was confirmed through Humphrey perimetry at two postscreening visits to the Clinical Center or Satellite Center. Eligible patients who agreed to participate had two additional visits for collection of baseline data. They were randomized to treatment with the beta blocker Betaxolol and argon laser trabeculoplasty (treated group) or to no initial treatment (control group) with close followup of both groups.

Patients are followed for a minimum of 4 years to assess the development of glaucoma progression. They are seen every 3 months to collect visual field, IOP, and other data. Disc photographs are taken every 6 months. Technicians and disc photograph graders are masked regarding treatment assignment. Additional followup visits are held to confirm visual field progression and IOP elevation (>25 mm Hg in treated group, >35 mm Hg in control group). Patients in the treated group receive Xalantan whenever IOP exceeds 25 mm Hg at more than one visit; patients in the control group will receive Xalantan whenever IOP reaches 35 mm Hg or higher during the trial. If IOP remains high, individualized treatment is given. All patients continue to be followed to monitor the development of end points and will be analyzed in their originally assigned groups.

The study outcome is glaucoma progression, which is based on specific criteria derived from analyses of Humphrey visual fields and masked evaluations of disc photographs. The perimetric outcome is defined as statistically significant deterioration (p < 0.05) of the same three or more test points in Pattern Deviation Change Probability Maps in three consecutive C30-2 Humphrey fields.

To determine the long-term outcome for eyes that had severe (""threshold"") ROP, both with and without cryotherapy.","ROP is a disease of the eyes of prematurely born infants in which the retinal blood vessels increase in number and branch excessively, sometimes leading to hemorrhage or scarring. Before the establishment of this study in 1985, more than 500 infants annually were blinded by ROP in the United States alone.

More than 30 years ago, the National Institutes of Health sponsored a clinical trial that showed that if premature babies are given oxygen only as needed, the number of infants who develop ROP drops dramatically. Subsequently, hospitals cut back on giving excessive oxygen routinely to premature babies. But, with improvements in neonatal care over the last two decades, the number of babies at risk is increasing as survival rates for smaller premature infants improve. The lower the birth weight, the higher the incidence and severity of ROP.

In a more recent NEI-supported study at the University of Miami, blood oxygen levels of very low birth-weight infants were monitored continuously by use of transcutaneous measurements as long as oxygen therapy was needed. The study showed that there is no statistically significant difference between the rates of ROP in infants monitored on continuous oxygen therapy and in those monitored only when they were receiving oxygen in excess of 40 percent.

The Supplemental Therapeutic Oxygen for Prethreshold ROP (STOP-ROP) trial, also funded by the NEI, studied whether a slight increase in oxygen therapy would prevent the progression of moderate ROP to ROP severe enough to require surgical treatment. This intervention made little or no difference in outcomes.

Likewise, another NEI-sponsored clinical trial (LIGHT-ROP) demonstrated absence of protective effect on ROP by limiting light exposure to newborn premature infants. These studies have led to the conclusion that factors other than oxygen or light exposure must be involved in causing ROP.

In most infants who develop ROP, the disease spontaneously subsides, permitting development of normal vision. But other infants who progress to a severe form of ROP are in danger of becoming permanently blind. Although the cause of ROP is not fully explained, scientists are seeking ways to treat ROP successfully and to find the right time in the progression of the disease to use treatment. Cryotherapy, which destroys the fringe of the retina through freezing, is the only treatment so far that has been demonstrated to provide substantial benefit to these eyes.

The multicenter trial of cryotherapy for ROP enrolled more than 4,000 premature infants who weighed no more than 1,250 grams at birth. This category of infants is at the greatest risk of developing ROP. The eyes of the infants enrolled in the study were examined at predetermined intervals while the subjects were still in the intensive care nursery. After the pupils were dilated with eye drops, the eyes were examined by an ophthalmologist using a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope to visualize the developing retina. The natural history of the condition of each infant's retina was recorded. When examination disclosed the severe form of ROP (threshold ROP) in both eyes, and the parents gave informed consent, one of the infant's eyes was randomly selected to receive cryotherapy. In this technique, a cryoprobe was used to freeze and thus destroy the peripheral extent of the retina, thereby arresting the development of the blood vessels growing wildly toward it.

Outcome of the therapy was assessed at 3 months and 12 months following randomization by an extensive examination that included photography of the interior of both the treated and the control eyes. The 12-month exam also measured visual function with preferential-looking techniques. Such measurements allowed correlations between fundus photographs and visual function and a comparison of visual function for treated versus control eyes. Neither the trained photograph readers who evaluated the pictures from both eyes nor the specially trained vision testers knew which eyes had received cryotherapy. Additional assessments of visual acuity and retinal status have been made approximately each year up to the present.

These three therapeutic regimens were (1) foscarnet, (2) high-dose ganciclovir, and (3) combination foscarnet and ganciclovir.

To compare two treatment strategies in patients with relapsed or nonresponsive CMV retinitis: (1) continuing the same anti-CMV drug or (2) switching to the alternate drug.","CMV retinitis is the most common intraocular infection in patients with AIDS and is estimated to affect 35 to 40 percent of patients with AIDS. Untreated CMV retinitis is a progressive disorder, the end result of which is total retinal destruction and blindness. At the time of this trial, drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CMV retinitis were ganciclovir (Cytovene) and foscarnet (Foscavir). Although most retinitis responds well to initial therapy with systemically administered drugs, given enough time, nearly all patients will suffer a relapse of the retinitis. Relapsed retinitis generally responds to reinduction and maintenance therapy, but the interval between successive relapses progressively shortens. The CRRT addressed the issue of the management of relapsed CMV retinitis.

The CRRT was a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing three regimens in patients with relapsed retinitis.

Untreated CMV retinitis is a progressive disorder, the end result of which is total retinal destruction and blindness. As of September 1996, drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CMV retinitis were ganciclovir (Cytovene), foscarnet (Foscavir), and cidofovir (Vistide). All systemically administered anti-CMV drugs are given in a similar fashion consisting of initial 2-week high-dose treatment (induction) to control the infection followed by long-term lower dose treatment (maintenance) to prevent relapse. Ganciclovir is available in both intravenous and oral formulations, foscarnet only in an intravenous formulation, and cidofovir is given by intermittent intravenous administration. A surgically implanted intraocular sustained-release ganciclovir device (Vitrasert) is also approved by the FDA for the treatment of CMV retinitis.

Despite the use of continuous maintenance therapy, given enough time, all patients with CMV retinitis on systemically administered drugs relapse. Preliminary studies suggested that the anti-CMV monoclonal antibody, MSL-109, when administered in conjunction with ganciclovir, markedly prolonged the time to relapse. Therefore, a randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating MSL-109 as adjunct therapy was conducted.

The MACRT was a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of MSL-109 as adjunct therapy for the treatment of CMV retinitis.

Untreated CMV retinitis is a progressive disorder, the end result of which is total retinal destruction and blindness. The first two drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CMV retinitis were ganciclovir (Cytovene) and foscarnet (Foscavir). At the time of this trial, both ganciclovir and foscarnet were available only as intravenous formulations. Both drugs were given in a similar two-step fashion: an initial 2-week course of high-dose therapy (induction) to control the infection followed by long-term lower dose therapy to prevent relapse (maintenance). The FGCRT compared foscarnet and ganciclovir as initial therapy for CMV retinitis.

The FGCRT was a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing foscarnet and ganciclovir as initial therapy for CMV retinitis.

Histocompatibility antigen matching and/or crossmatching may have offered these patients an improved chance for successful outcome.

The Collaborative Corneal Transplantation Studies Group conducted two controlled, double-masked studies addressing distinct scientific questions about donor-recipient histocompatibility matching. The Crossmatch Study was a randomized study assessing the effectiveness of crossmatching in preventing graft rejection among high-risk patients with lymphocytotoxic antibodies. The Antigen Matching Study was a prospective, double-masked, observational study of the effectiveness of HLA-A, -B, and -DR donor-recipient matching in high-risk patients who had no lymphocytotoxic antibodies.

Six clinical centers recruited high-risk patients and collaborated with their local eye banking and organ procurement agencies in procuring donor corneal tissue. For each of the two studies, a total of 400 patients were sought. Blood samples from each enrolled patient were sent to the local CCTS tissue typing laboratory for HLA typing, and serum samples were sent to the Central Laboratory to be screened for preformed lymphocytotoxic antibodies. Depending on the results of the testing, patients were entered into the Crossmatch Study or the Antigen Matching Study.

As corneal donors became available, donor blood samples were HLA typed at the local laboratories and crossmatched against all CCTS patients who awaited transplantation. Results of the testing were entered in a national, 24-hour computerized allocation system operated by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). Patients in the Crossmatch Study received a cornea from either a positively crossmatched donor or a negatively crossmatched donor. Patients in the Antigen Matching Study received a cornea with 0 to 6 matched antigens.

Transplant patients were followed intensively during the first months after surgery. The number of clinic visits was tapered to 2 during the third and final year of followup, resulting in a total of 17 postoperative visits. Irreversible failure of the corneal allograft due to all causes was the primary outcome variable in both studies. Allograft reaction episodes, irreversible failure due to rejection, and visual acuity were secondary outcome variables.",Interventional,"Males and females age 10 years or older with two to four quadrants of corneal stroma vascularization or a history of allograft rejection in the eye considered for surgery were eligible for both studies in the CCTS.

Patients must have been willing to participate in 3 years of followup. No one was eligible for the CCTS who had a condition that would greatly increase the risk of nonrejection graft failure, such as xerophthalmia or severe exposure keratopathy.

To evaluate the efficacy of oral acyclovir in treating herpes simplex iridocyclitis in conjunction with treatment with topical corticosteroids and trifluridine.","Herpes simplex keratitis is a leading cause of corneal opacification in the United States, other industrialized countries, and developing nations throughout the world. An estimated 450,000 people in the United States can develop recurrent episodes of the disease and about 46,000 episodes of HSV eye infection every year. Herpetic eye disease is the most common infectious cause of corneal blindness in this country.

Despite the availability of antiviral agents that are effective in treating herpes simplex epithelial keratitis, inflammation in the corneal connective tissue and iris that can lead to corneal scarring and visual impairment develops in many patients. Prior to the HEDS-I trials, the role of topical corticosteroids in the management of HSV stromal keratitis was uncertain; some animal and human studies suggested there was a benefit to treatment whereas others suggested harm. The value of adding an oral antiviral agent to treatment with topical corticosteroids and topical antivirals also was unknown.

The HEDS-I trials were developed to assess the efficacy of topical corticosteroids and oral acyclovir in treating HSV stromal keratitis and iridocyclitis.

HEDS-I consisted of three randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The organizational structure consisted of a data coordinating center and eight clinical centers.

All patients received the topical antiviral trifluridine as prophylaxis against recurrences of HSV epithelial ulceration. Patients were evaluated weekly for 10 weeks, every other week through week 16, and again at 6 months. The primary outcome was the time to development of preset criteria for treatment failure during the 16-week period of examination. Protocol-specific descriptions of the three trials follow.

Herpes Stromal Keratitis, Not on Steroid Trial (HEDS-SKN): Patients with active HSV stromal keratitis who had not used a topical corticosteroid in the preceding 10 days were randomized to treatment with topical prednisolone phosphate drops or topical placebo drops. A treatment schedule, starting with 8 drops a day of 1 percent prednisolone phosphate for 7 days, was progressively decreased over 10 weeks in such a way that patients received 1 drop per day of 1/8 percent prednisolone for the last 3 weeks of treatment. Placebo drops were given by the same schedule.

Herpes Stromal Keratitis, on Steroid Treatment (HEDS-SKS): Patients with active HSV stromal keratitis who already were being treated with a topical corticosteroid were randomized either to oral treatment with 200 mg acyclovir capsules (400 mg five times daily) for 10 weeks or to the identical dose of placebo capsules. Patients also received topical prednisolone phosphate in the dosage schedule described above for the SKN trial.

Herpes Simplex Virus Iridocyclitis, Receiving Topical Steroids (HEDS-IRT): Patients with active HSV iridocyclitis were randomized either to oral treatment with 200 mg acyclovir capsules (400 mg five times daily) for 10 weeks or to the identical dose of placebo capsules. Patients also received topical prednisolone phosphate in the dosage schedule described above for the SKN trial.",Interventional,"Eligibility criteria common to the three protocols included age 12 years or older, no active HSV epithelial keratitis, no prior keratoplasty of the involved eye, and not pregnant.

To determine the role of external factors (such as ultraviolet light or corneal trauma) and behavioral factors (such as life stress) on the induction of ocular recurrences of HSV eye infections and disease.","Infection of the eye by herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a leading cause of corneal blindness in the United States and other countries. The infection can lead to corneal scarring and neovascularization, permanent endothelial dysfunction and corneal edema, secondary glaucoma, and cataract. Despite the availability of topical antiviral agents that are highly active against HSV keratitis, there is still no known effective method for reducing the frequency of recurrence or severity of stromal keratitis and iridocyclitis. In addition, the prognosis is poor for recovery of good vision following penetrating keratoplasty for actively inflamed or highly vascularized herpetic corneas.

On the basis of both animal and human studies, the antiviral agent acyclovir may both treat and prevent recurrence of HSV disease. However, no consensus yet exists on the use of acyclovir in the management and prevention of herpetic eye disease.

HEDS-II consists of two randomized, placebo-controlled trials that are assessing the role of oral acyclovir in the management of herpetic eye disease and one epidemiologic study that is investigating risk factors, including stress, for the development of ocular recurrences of the disease. The organizational structure consists of a national coordinating center, eight regional coordinating clinical centers, and approximately 60 clinical sites. The clinical sites where patients are enrolled and followed include both university-based and community-based practices.

Herpes Simplex Virus Epithelial Keratitis Trial: HEDS-EKT evaluated the benefit of oral acyclovir given during treatment of an acute HSV keratitis (dendritic or geographic keratitis) in preventing the occurrence of later blinding complications. Patients entered the trial within 7 days of onset. All patients received standard treatment with a topical antiviral and were randomized to receive either oral acyclovir (400 mg five times a day for 21 days) or a placebo. Patients had eight visits within a 12-month followup period. The primary outcome was the time to the first occurrence of stromal keratitis or iridocyclitis in the study eye (eye with epithelial keratitis at time of study entry). The HEDS-EKT recruitment goal was 502 patients.

Acyclovir Prevention Trial: HEDS-APT evaluated the benefit of long-term acyclovir treatment in patients with a recent history of HSV eye disease but no current active disease. To be eligible, a patient must have experienced any kind of ocular herpes simplex infection (blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, or iridocyclitis) in the preceding year. The infection must have been inactive and untreated for at least the previous 30 days. Patients were randomized to receive either oral acyclovir (400 mg twice a day) or placebo for 1 year. Five followup visits occurred during the 1-year treatment period and an additional three followup visits during the 6-month post-treatment period. Episodes of recurrent HSV eye disease during the trial were treated with topical corticosteroids and antivirals as indicated, but patients continued to receive the oral acyclovir or placebo for the entire 365-day period. The primary outcome was the time to the first recurrence of any type of HSV eye disease in either eye. The recruitment goal was 696 patients.

Ocular HSV Recurrence Factor Study: HEDS-RFS is evaluating the effect of psychological, environmental, and biological factors on recurrences of herpetic eye disease. Patients recruited into the HEDS-APT trial are eligible to participate in HEDS-RFS if they are 18 years or older. At entry, all subjects fill out a questionnaire to estimate the negative affectivity trait measure. Subjects also fill out a short questionnaire every week for 52 weeks to track acute and chronic stressors (e.g., illnesses, injuries, menstrual periods, sun exposure, emotional and financial stresses).

To evaluate the ocular complications that result from the use of silicone oil and gas.","The treatment of retinal detachment complicated by PVR remains controversial. Although some cases are managed successfully by pars plana vitrectomy and with temporary tamponade provided by intraocular gas, others eventually redetach with this technique. Preliminary reports indicate that prolonged tamponade with liquid silicone results in improved anatomical success, but the eventual visual outcome may be prejudiced by silicone-related complications, particularly glaucoma and keratopathy. The addition of hydraulic reattachment by simultaneous fluid/gas exchange to vitrectomy surgery has proved to be an important development. Although complications are few with these procedures, subsequent redetachment is frequent.

The Silicone Study was a randomized trial to investigate the relative merits of silicone oil or gas as tamponade modalities. All study patients underwent vitrectomy and were randomized intraoperatively either to silicone oil or to gas. Two groups of eyes were entered into the study: eyes that had not had a prior vitrectomy (Group 1) and those that had undergone previous vitrectomy outside the study (Group 2).

A critical element in the study was a standardized surgical procedure for PVR. This surgical procedure, intended to relieve retinal traction with vitrectomy techniques, was followed by assessment of the relief provided by an intraocular air tamponade. The eye was randomized to silicone oil or gas only after completion of the entire surgical procedure to eliminate investigator bias that might develop through knowledge of the treatment modality. Patients were examined 5 to 14 days following the randomization and again at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months after that date. Repeated surgery was permitted for either treatment modality. The Fundus Photograph Reading Center staff processed and analyzed photographs taken at all the clinics, graded the preoperative severity of PVR on the basis of baseline visit photographs, and confirmed the macular status at followup visits.

End points of the study were visual acuity of 5/200 or greater and macular reattachment for 6 months following the final surgical procedure.

Untreated CMV (cytomegalovirus) retinitis is a progressive disorder, the end result of which is total retinal destruction and blindness. As of September 1997, drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CMV (cytomegalovirus)retinitis were ganciclovir (Cytovene), foscarnet (Foscavir), and cidofovir (Vistide).

To compare a treatment regimen that incorporates highly active local therapy (ganciclovir device) with a treatment regimen that does not.","Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is among the most frequently encountered opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS. In the era of prophylaxis for pneumocystic pneumonia, CMV disease is estimated to affect 45 percent of patients with AIDS sometime between the diagnosis of AIDS and death. Retinitis has been estimated to account for up to 85 percent of CMV disease in these patients, making CMV retinitis the most common ocular infection encountered. CMV retinitis is a relatively late-stage manifestation, associated with cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) + T-cell counts < 100 cells/µL and often < 50 cells/µL.

All currently available treatments for CMV suppress viral replication but do not eliminate the virus from the body. Discontinuation of therapy is associated with a prompt relapse of the retinitis. Despite the use of chronic suppressive therapy, relapse of the retinitis generally occurs, at least with systemically administered anti-CMV drugs.

The first two treatments approved for CMV retinitis were intravenous ganciclovir and intravenous foscarnet. Both are given by daily intravenous infusions and therefore require central venous catheters. The development of newer treatments has focused not only on efficacious treatments, but also on treatments that do not require central venous catheters. Available treatments now include oral ganciclovir, the ganciclovir intraocular device, and intravenous cidofovir.

In vitro data suggest that combination therapies are synergistic in inhibiting viral replication; these therapies include a foscarnet-ganciclovir combination and a cidofovir-ganciclovir combination. In the SOCA--CMV Retinitis Retreatment Trial, the combination of intravenous ganciclovir and foscarnet was more effective than either drug alone for the treatment of relapsed retinitis. Therefore, the combination of intermittent intravenous cidofovir and daily oral ganciclovir may be an attractive therapy for relapsed disease because it may provide synergy for controlling both ocular and visceral disease while not necessitating either a central venous catheter or an intraocular surgical procedure.

The Ganciclovir-Cidofovir CMV Retinitis Trial (GCCRT) is a randomized, multicenter clinical trial. Patients will be assigned to receive one of two regimens: (1) ganciclovir intraocular device plus oral ganciclovir or (2) intravenous cidofovir. The intraocular device will be surgically implanted at baseline and again every 6 to 8 months in eyes with CMV retinitis. Oral ganciclovir is taken at a dose of 1 gram three times daily. Cidofovir will be administered intravenously at 5 mg/kg once weekly for 2 consecutive weeks and once every 2 weeks thereafter. If disease progression occurs in patients receiving cidofovir, patients will be given reinduction therapy, and oral ganciclovir at a dose of 1 gram three times per day will be added to the treatment. If patients assigned to cidofovir are unable to tolerate that regimen, an alternative systemic regimen will be recommended.

Study outcome variables include a decrease of three or more lines from baseline in best corrected visual acuity and rate of visual field loss. The study will also assess other variables including mortality, blood CMV and HIV load, quality of life, and medical costs.

ALT treatment consists of tiny laser burns evenly spaced around the trabecular meshwork. It sometimes has been found to be effective in controlling glaucoma, although many eyes still require some medical treatment.

The Glaucoma Laser Trial (GLT), a randomized, controlled clinical trial, was conducted to determine whether ALT is effective in patients with newly diagnosed, primary, open-angle glaucoma. Each of the 271 patients in the trial received argon laser treatment in one eye and standard topical medication in the other eye. The eye to be started on medicine and the eye that would get the laser treatment were randomly selected. The Glaucoma Laser Trial Followup Study was a followup study of 203 of the 271 patients who enrolled in the Glaucoma Laser Trial. By the close of the Glaucoma Laser Trial Followup Study, median duration of followup since diagnosis of primary, open-angle glaucoma was 7 years (maximum, 9 years).

The argon laser treatment was done in two sessions 1 month apart, with one-half of the trabecular meshwork treated with 45 to 55 laser burns in each session. Patients were seen for a followup visit 3 months after the first laser treatment and every 3 months thereafter for a period of at least 2 years. At each visit, examination of the eyes included a check of intraocular pressure and visual acuity. Visual field examinations were performed 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization and annually thereafter. Disc stereo photographs were taken 6 and 12 months after randomization and annually thereafter.

The results of these examinations determined whether treatment should be changed. If the pressure in either eye had not been reduced to the desired level, the physician changed the medication in the eye treated with drops or started the use of drops in the laser-treated eye according to a standardized procedure being used in the trial. If intraocular pressure was still not successfully reduced, surgery or further laser treatment may have been required.",Interventional,"At the time of recruitment, patients had to be at least 35 years old with an intraocular pressure of at least 22 mm Hg or greater in each eye and evidence of optic nerve damage in at least one eye.",No,All,35 Years,,

To evaluate, in randomized clinical trials, the effects of pharmacologic doses of (1) antioxidants and zinc on the progression of AMD and (2) antioxidants on the development and progression of lens opacities.","AMD and cataract are the leading causes of visual impairment and blindness in the United States. Based on many clinical studies, it is apparent that the frequency of both diseases increases dramatically after age 60. Although excellent treatments for cataract are available, there are no equivalent treatments for AMD. As the average lifespan of our population increases, the number of people who develop AMD will increase dramatically in the years ahead. Unless successful means of prevention or treatment are developed, blindness from AMD -- and its importance as a public health problem -- will increase.

Neither the etiology nor the natural history of AMD or cataract is known. Epidemiologic studies suggest that a number of risk factors may be associated with AMD and cataract, but the strength of the evidence in support of these hypotheses varies. Possibly associated with AMD are personal characteristics, such as age, race, height, family history, and strength of hand grip; ocular characteristics, such as hyperopia and color of iris; and cardiovascular diseases, smoking, lung infections, and chemical exposures. Clinical and laboratory studies suggest the following factors may be associated with progression of AMD: drusen type, choroidal vascular diseases, and photic injury.

Epidemiologic studies of cataract suggest that associated risk factors may include personal characteristics, such as age, sex, race, occupation, and educational status; ocular characteristics, such as iris color; and diabetes mellitus, hypertension, drug exposure, smoking, and sunlight exposure. Animal studies and observational epidemiologic studies suggest that deficiencies in vitamins C and E, carotenoids, and the trace elements zinc and selenium also may be associated with the development of the two diseases, especially cataract. Although surgical treatment to remove cataract is very effective, cataract surgery carries risks, as does any other surgery. Therefore, many research efforts focus on preventing or slowing cataract development, as well as on determining the causes of cataract formation.

Before 1980, some type of filtering surgery, such as trabeculectomy, was the usual method of intervention. Since then, laser trabeculoplasty has become a popular alternative. Sometimes the first intervention chosen succeeds in controlling pressure for many years; at other times, the success lasts only a few weeks or months. Because success is limited, some patients, over time, need to undergo a sequence of surgical interventions. Little is known about which sequence gives the best long-range outcome.

The Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) is designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the long-range outcomes of medical and surgical management in advanced glaucoma. The study uses visual function status to compare two intervention sequences in managing the disease.

Eligible eyes are randomly assigned to one of two intervention sequences: (1) trabeculectomy, followed by argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) should trabeculectomy fail, followed by a second trabeculectomy should ALT fail; or (2) ALT, followed by trabeculectomy should ALT fail, followed by another trabeculectomy should the first trabeculectomy fail. Antifibrotic agents may be used as an adjunct to trabeculectomy, but only in eyes with a previous history of invasive surgery. Eyes that fail the entire assigned sequence of interventions are managed at the discretion of the AGIS physician in collaboration with the patient.

Interventions are supplemented with medical treatment as needed. A total of 789 eyes with advanced glaucoma have been enrolled. All patients are being followed under a standardized protocol for a minimum of 5 years to determine degree of visual function loss, failure rates of interventions, rates of complications, and need for supplemental therapy.

After the initial intervention, followup examinations are scheduled at 1 week, 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter. After second and third interventions, followup examinations are scheduled at 1 and 4 weeks. Additional visits are scheduled as necessary for the management of the disease.

The primary outcome variable in AGIS is average percent of eyes with decrease of vision, where decrease of vision is a substantial decline of either visual field or visual acuity attributable to the effect of glaucoma. Secondary outcome variables include sustained decrease of vision, failure of interventions, number of prescribed glaucoma medications, and level of intraocular pressure.

In addition, increased attention to the impact of therapy on health-related quality of life has added another consideration in deciding upon appropriate treatment of such patients.

The Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study (CIGTS), a randomized, controlled clinical trial, is being conducted to determine whether patients with newly diagnosed OAG are best managed by the conventional approach of topical pharmacologic agents or by immediate filtration surgery. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either a stepped medication treatment regimen or filtration surgery to control their OAG. Sample size requirements indicated that 300 patients were needed for each treatment approach; a total of 607 patients were ultimately recruited for the CIGTS.

Patients randomized to the medication treatment arm are receiving a stepped regimen of topical medications, beginning with a single agent (typically a beta blocker), with additional medications added upon documented lack of intraocular pressure control or evidence of progressive visual field loss. If medications fail to control the patient's OAG, a series of treatment steps begin with argon laser trabeculoplasty and conclude with trabeculectomy.

In the surgical treatment arm, patients underwent immediate trabeculectomy and, with documented failure, proceed to argon laser trabeculectomy, then conclude with medications. Patients, rather than eyes, are randomized to the two treatment arms; if both eyes are eligible for treatment, the treatment course for both eyes is the same and was determined in the randomization.

Following randomization, participating community ophthalmologists affiliated with the study have been allowed to manage the medical and surgical care of study patients. However, all patients are seen at the Clinical Centers for standardized followup examinations at 3 and 6 months after treatment and every 6 months thereafter; in addition, patients randomized to the surgical arm will receive, at a minimum, postsurgical followup at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month. At the Clinical Center visits, examination of the eye(s) includes evaluation of visual acuity, visual field, and intraocular pressure. The results of these tests determine whether treatment should be changed. In addition, before and at regular intervals after treatment, patients are being interviewed by telephone to assess their health-related quality of life.

To determine how surgical removal compared to observation of subfoveal CNV due to AMD, OHS, or idiopathic causes changes the patient's perception of health- and vision-related ""quality of life,"" as measured by telephone interview using the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 (MOS SF-36) instrument, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25).

To determine whether randomized trials of surgery are warranted for patients with subfoveal CNV associated with age-related macular degeneration not suitable for laser treatment.","Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with CNV is the most common cause of irreversible severe loss of vision in older adults. The Macular Photocoagulation Study (MPS) Group, sponsored by the National Eye Institute, demonstrated that laser treatment is effective for recurrent subfoveal CNV (that extends into the center of the macula) after laser treatment and for selected patients with subfoveal CNV who had no prior treatment. More recently, photodynamic therapy with verteporfin was shown to reduce the risk of moderate and server loss of vision in selected patients with subfoveal neovascularization associated with AMD. Choroidal neovascularization due to OHS affects adults of working age and may pose a lifelong risk of blindness to people who have characteristic scars (""histo spots"") in the macula. It has been estimated that 2,000,000 people who live or have lived in the region of the United States in which histoplasmosis is endemic have characteristic histo spots and that 100,000 of them will lose vision in one or both eyes due to CNV. Fortunately, the effectiveness of laser photocoagulation for treating CNV due to OHS that is not subfoveal (i.e., not extending into the center of the macula) also has been demonstrated by the MPS Group in two randomized clinical trials. However, treated patients are at risk of subfoveal recurrence, and laser treatment cannot be applied to these patients or to other patients with OHS who present with subfoveal CNV in the absence of prior laser treatment.

Recently, alternative therapies to laser photocoagulation and photodynamic therapy have been proposed for the management of CNV and are intended to increase the chance of stabilizing or improving vision at a greater rate than with observation. The most promising of these alternatives at this time is surgical removal of the neovascular lesion, i.e., submacular surgery. The rationale for this surgical approach is that removal of the CNV may halt enlargement of the visual defect, spare photoreceptors in the central macula, and allow adjacent ocular structures to function normally. Data regarding the effectiveness of this approach is limited to reports of case series which suffer from the absence of untreated controls, limited number of cases evaluated, or lack of long term follow-up to assess the impact of recurrent CNV, delayed atrophy of the outer retina, and adverse outcomes such as cataract and retinal detachment, requiring additional treatment.

The Submacular Surgery Trials comprise a set of multicenter, randomized clinical trials with the goal of determining whether surgical removal of subfoveal CNV stabilizes or improves vision more often than observation. A total of 19 clinical centers collaborated in conducting a clinical trial for patients with neovascular OHS and idiopathic CNV (Group H protocol). The target sample size for the Group H protocol was 250 participants to be enrolled and followed for 4 years. A total of 29 clinical centers collaborated in conducting two additional clinical trials for patients with neovascular AMD. The target sample size for these AMD trials was 960 participants to be enrolled and followed for 4 years.

Vision data collected at baseline include a protocol refraction, best-corrected logMAR visual acuity (ETDRS charts), contrast threshold (Pelli-Robson charts), and reading speed (enlarged text). Other baseline data recorded include stereoscopic color fundus photographs, fluorescein angiograms, and lens photographs, as well as health- and vision-related quality of life interview data (by telephone).

Eligible patients who gave signed, informed consent were randomly assigned to surgery (within 8 days of randomization) or observation. Patients, assigned to surgery, are seen one month post-surgery for an examination and photographs. All participants are examined at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after randomization to collect vision data (collected in a masked fashion at 24 and 48 months after randomization) and to repeat photography. Quality of life telephone interviews are repeated at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after randomization.

The primary outcome is improvement in visual acuity from baseline to the two-year examination or retention of baseline visual acuity through the two-year examination. Secondary outcomes include change in quality of life from baseline to the 2- and 4-year examinations, change in visual acuity over 4 years, large losses of visual acuity, and adverse ocular outcomes (e.g., those requiring additional treatment such as cataract, retinal detachment, or recurrent CNV).",Interventional,"Group B: Patients with evidence of large hemorrhages from subfoveal neovascular AMD lesions, visual acuity (SST protocol) of 20/100 to light perception, with the area of hemorrhage larger than the area of fluorescein angiographically visible CNV, with any visible CNV less than or equal to 9 MPS disc areas, and ability to return for 4 years of follow-up may be eligible for the Group B (Blood) protocol.

A total of 3,711 patients were recruited to be followed for a minimum of 4 years to provide long-term information on the risks and benefits of the treatments under study.

The eligibility criteria for the ETDRS were designed to include a broad range of macular edema severity, from a few small hard exudates within a disc diameter of the fovea with normal visual acuity to extensive cystoid spaces with a visual acuity of 20/200. All study patients had one eye randomly assigned to immediate photocoagulation and the other eye to deferral of photocoagulation until high-risk proliferative retinopathy developed. During followup, additional photocoagulation was allowed for any degree of macular edema within the eligibility range, but additional photocoagulation was required only for edema involving or threatening the center of the macula. The term ""clinically significant macular edema"" was coined to designate this level of severity.

The trial use of aspirin therapy was based on clinical observation and on aspirin's possible mechanisms of action. Previous observations of diabetic patients who were taking large doses of aspirin for rheumatoid arthritis showed that the prevalence of retinopathy in this group was lower than the prevalence that would be expected in the diabetic population at large. Evidence suggested that diabetic patients have altered platelet aggregation and disaggregation, which may contribute to the capillary closure seen in retinopathy. This abnormality is reversed by aspirin in vitro . However, because of aspirin's other possible mechanisms of action and its well-known side effects, such as allergic, idiosyncratic, and intolerance reactions, the use of this therapy in the ETDRS was carefully controlled and monitored.",Interventional,"Men and women between the ages of 18 and 70 years with moderate or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or mild proliferative retinopathy in both eyes, with no previous photocoagulation treatment, and with visual acuity of 20/40 or better (20/200 or better if macular edema is present) were eligible for this study.",No,All,18 Years,70 Years,

To identify potential risk factors for development of AMD. Possible risk factors include height, systemic hypertension, cardiovascular disease, blood cholesterol, cigarette smoking, iris and skin color, sunlight exposure, body mass index, diabetes, and alcohol intake.","Macular degeneration, a major cause of blindness in the United States, is the leading cause of new cases of blindness in people aged 65 and older. The National Eye Institute estimates that each year an additional 165,000 people, mainly in the older age groups, develop macular disease. Among all people with macular degeneration, approximately 116,000 are affected by the neovascular form of the disease. Although laser treatment is an effective treatment for patients with certain forms of neovascular membranes (exudative AMD), for most patients there is no available treatment.

The pathogenesis of AMD is only partly understood, and its etiology remains obscure. The Retinal and Choroidal Diseases Panel of the National Advisory Eye Council has stated that ""none of the fundamental causes of any type of macular disease is known, and none can be prevented."" Thus, this panel recommended that one of the NEI's program development priorities should be to ""initiate epidemiologic studies of macular diseases to identify possible causative, protective, or aggravating factors.""

This trial is part of the Physicians Health Study, sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health, with funding for eye epidemiologic data evaluations provided by the NEI. It is an ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin in the prevention of cardiovascular mortality and of beta-carotene in the prevention of cancer. Following randomization, each of the 22,071 physicians enrolled was assigned to one of four groups to take either aspirin or its placebo and beta-carotene or its placebo. Followup questionnaires are sent 6 and 12 months after randomization and every 12 months thereafter. The average length of followup is now greater than 12 years.

The hypothesis that beta-carotene levels are inversely related to AMD is supported by experimental studies on the relationship between antioxidants and retinal morphology and function. There is increasing evidence that visible and ultraviolet light can damage the retina through production of superoxide radicals. Antioxidants (including beta-carotene, vitamins A, E, and C, and selenium) protect against oxidative damage by acting as scavengers for the superoxide radicals.

Epidemiologic data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-1) are also consistent with a link between antioxidants and AMD; the frequency of consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin A (beta-carotene) was negatively correlated with AMD after adjustment for demographic and medical factors.

Data from this study will determine whether one 50-mg beta-carotene capsule taken on alternate days protects against the development of AMD and whether additional risk factors emerge after simultaneous controlling for other potential confounding factors.

Reported diagnoses of AMD are confirmed by medical record review. The primary analysis will be a comparison of incidence of reported AMD in the beta-carotene and placebo groups. The Cox proportional hazards model will also be used to determine whether there is a difference in time to diagnosis of AMD between the two groups.",Interventional,"When the Physicians Health Study was established in the early 1980s by the NHLBI to collect data on a stable population at risk for heart attack, only male physicians were studied because males were thought to be at higher risk than females for ischemic heart problems.

To assess the vision of study patients.

To test the feasibility of a prototype NEI-sponsored multicenter clinical trial in which participating clinics are not financially reimbursed and in which both the Coordinating and Fundus Photograph Reading Center functions are carried out by staff of the NEI Biometry and Epidemiology Program.","The KARNS was a randomized clinical trial designed to compare the effectiveness of argon and krypton laser photocoagulation in causing the regression of preexisting neovascularization on the disc (NVD) in diabetic retinopathy. The main theoretical advantage for the krypton laser in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy is that the red laser beam penetrates blood and may be more effective in making burns in the pigment epithelium in eyes with vitreous hemorrhage.

The burns produced by the krypton laser in the retina are different from those produced by the argon laser. Specifically, the burns from the krypton laser do not involve the inner retina. Also, the krypton laser spares the nerve fiber layer near the macula. In contrast, nerve fiber layer burns are common with the argon laser. Pigment epithelium and outer segments are usually destroyed by both krypton and argon photocoagulation, but there is no uptake of energy by the vascular tissues within the retina when krypton photocoagulation is used. Further, krypton treatment is more effective in penetrating nuclear sclerosis of the lens and can be used to treat some diabetic eyes with this condition that cannot be treated with the argon laser.

In the KARNS, patients with diabetic retinopathy and NVD of one-third disc area or greater in extent were assigned at random to either argon or krypton laser scatter photocoagulation (panretinal photocoagulation). The null hypothesis was that each treatment would result in a similar proportion of eyes having regression of the NVD by 3 months. The KARNS pilot study affirmed the benefits of argon laser photocoagulation in the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, as demonstrated in the NEI-supported Diabetic Retinopathy Study conducted a decade ago. (See publication list.) The KARNS study sought to determine whether use of the krypton laser could be as effective as the argon laser in causing regression of diabetic neovascularization, but with fewer side effects (such as smaller loss of central visual acuity).

Thirty-two nationwide clinical centers participated initially in this multicenter clinical trial. Following the initial study examination, the baseline examination and fundus photographs were obtained within 1 week before application of photocoagulation. Study followup visits occurred at 3 months and 1 year after entry in the study. Additional visits were scheduled as clinically necessary.

The specific techniques for photocoagulation were similar for both argon and krypton scatter photocoagulation. Scatter (panretinal) photocoagulation consisted of 1,600 to 2,000 burns placed 0.5 to 1 burn width apart. Burns of moderate intensity (whiteness) and 500 ??m in size at the retina were required. The burns were applied to the retinal periphery no closer than 2 disc diameters from the center of the fovea and 500 ??m from the margin of the optic disc.

In December 1985, the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study groups reported that focal photocoagulation was effective in reducing the rates of moderate visual loss in patients with clinically significant diabetic macular edema. The KARNS protocol was then changed to allow focal treatment for clinically significant macular edema in all study participants and to allow an eye that had previous focal photocoagulation for macular edema to become eligible for study.

The study primary end point was regression of NVD, as assessed on the 3-month visit stereo fundus photographs of the disc, to less than one-third disc area in extent. Secondary end points included change in extent of NVD, change in visual acuity after photocoagulation, development of fibrous tissue proliferation, and change or development of macular traction lines.",Interventional,"Men and women ages 18 through 79 diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and who had neovascularization on the optic nerve head (NVD) were eligible.

Patient's ocular media must have been clear enough for fundus photography, which allowed the extent of neovascularization on the optic nerve head to be assessed. (If vitreous hemorrhage or other media opacity prevented adequate visualization of the neovascularization, it would greatly impair the ability to assess the effect of photocoagulation.) Another requirement for patient eligibility was the presence of an area of at least three quadrants of the retina in which full argon or krypton laser panretinal photocoagulation could be placed.

It is important to determine whether early intervention with vitrectomy has a better visual outcome or instead produces a rate of serious complications higher than the rate associated with conventional management.

Two randomized trials were carried out in the DRVS among patients ages 18 to 70 years who had either insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent diabetes. In the first trial, the 616 patients who were recruited had severe visual loss from recent severe vitreous hemorrhage in at least one eye. Eligible eyes were randomly assigned either to early vitrectomy or to conventional management. In the conventional management group, vitrectomy was carried out 1 year later if hemorrhage persisted; vitrectomy was carried out sooner if retinal detachment -involving the center of the macula occurred.

In the second trial, 381 patients were recruited, all of whom had severe fibrovascular proliferations and useful vision in at least one eye. Eligible eyes were assigned either to early vitrectomy or to conventional management. Conventional management included photocoagulation when indicated, with vitrectomy if a severe vitreous hemorrhage occurred and failed to clear spontaneously during a 6-month waiting period or if retinal detachment involving the center of the macula -occurred. After randomization and treatment, all patients were examined at 6-month intervals for 2 years and annually thereafter. Comparisons of visual acuity distributions between experimental and control groups were made.",Interventional,"Men and women eligible for the vitreous hemorrhage group had at least one eye with recent severe vitreous hemorrhage (within 5 months) and visual acuity of 5/200 or less.

To identify risk factors and protective factors that influence the severity and progression of keratoconus.","Keratoconus is a bilateral, asymmetric, chronic, progressive ectasia of the cornea characterized by steepening and distortion of the cornea, thinning of the apical cornea, corneal scarring, and treatment-related sequelae, such as abrasions from contact lenses and surgical complications. Patients experience distorted vision that worsens with disease progression. Their vision is typically corrected with spectacles early in the disease and, later, with rigid contact lenses. Some patients eventually undergo corneal transplantation in one or both eyes. Keratoconus affects people in their prime earning years and profoundly affects their lives.

Previous large-scale studies of keratoconus have focused on incidence and prevalence, etiologies, or the clinical management of keratoconus. Few have characterized the course of the disease and risk factors for its progression in large samples of keratoconus patients. The incidence of vision-threatening corneal scarring in keratoconus is unknown. Patient's most frequent questions--how rapidly their keratoconus will progress, how bad their vision will become, whether they will need corneal surgery, how successful their contact lenses will be--cannot be answered on the basis of the current body of knowledge.

The need for a prospective, observational study of keratoconus patients is great. Results from this study will address keratoconus patient's unanswered questions and will enable eye care practitioners to manage this complex ocular disease better.

The Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus (CLEK) Study is a multicenter, observational study of 1,209 keratoconus patients followed for 3 years.

Patients are examined annually. Study measures include visual acuity, patient-reported quality of life, manifest refraction, keratometry, photodocumentation of the cornea to identify central corneal scarring, photodocumentation of the flattest contact lens that just clears the cornea, slit lamp biomicroscopy, and corneal topography. In rigid contact lens wearers, the fluorescein pattern of the patient's habitual contact lenses is photodocumented.

Patients are examined at 15 clinical centers. The clinical centers enrolled 1,209 patients in 12 months.",Observational,"Patients with keratoconus were eligible if they were at least 12 years old; had an irregular cornea as determined by keratometry, retinoscopy, or direct ophthalmoscopy in at least one eye; had Vogt's striae, Fleischer's ring, or corneal scarring characteristic of keratoconus in at least one eye; and planned to stay in the area for at least 3 years.

430756,NCT00000156,NEI-58,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,The Effects of Light Reduction on Retinopathy of Prematurity (Light-ROP),October 2003,Completed,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,To evaluate the effect of ambient light reduction on the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).,"Despite progress during the past decade in treatment of ROP, this disease still poses a significant (approximately 2.1 percent) risk of blindness to extremely low birth-weight (<1,251 grams) preterm infants. Current estimates indicate that about 27,000 infants of extremely low birth weight are born annually, of which 74 percent will survive. As techniques of managing smaller and less mature preterm infants continue to improve, it is expected that the number of infants at risk for blindness will continue to increase.

For infants weighing less than 1,251 grams at birth, the Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity (CRYO-ROP) Study has shown that the risk of developing severe, acute (threshold) ROP is 6 percent. Although cryotherapy, when applied at the time of threshold ROP, reduces the rate of unfavorable visual outcome, 35 percent of eyes that develop this level of severe, acute disease are blind 1 year after treatment. Moreover, cryotherapy is destructive. Even when cryotherapy prevents progression to retinal detachment, it is associated with peripheral retinal destruction and may, in some cases, be associated with subnormal central vision due to high myopia and/or macular scarring. Corrective surgical treatments for retinal detachment caused by ROP have proven to be of little visual benefit. A preventive treatment for ROP that is safe, efficacious, easily applied, and inexpensive is desirable.

The investigators hypothesize that reducing the amount of light that reaches the eyes of preterm infants may be effective in preventing ROP. Although previous reports on the use of light reduction to the eyes of preterm infants in the nursery have produced conflicting results, there are sufficient reasons to believe that this strategy may be effective in reducing the incidence and severity of ROP. These reasons center on the role of light in the production of destructive free radicals. Supplemental oxygen produces the same free radicals, and the two mechanisms may be additive.

In this masked, controlled study, infants weighing less than 1,251 grams at birth were prospectively randomized within 24 hours of birth to wear goggles or not to wear goggles. Goggles contain 97 percent near neutral density filters and were worn until the infant reached either 31 weeks gestational age or 4 weeks postnatal age, whichever was longer. The goggled and nongoggled infants were exposed to the same ambient light conditions within any given Study Center. Eyes of all infants were examined on a prescribed schedule by certified examiners to determine the incidence of any confirmed ROP.

The primary objective of this study is to answer the following question: Does light reduction to the eyes of extremely low birth-weight infants decrease the incidence of any confirmed ROP (at least 3 contiguous clock hours, any stage, any zone)? The primary end points are therefore ROP or full vascularization.

The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the following question: Does light reduction to the eyes of extremely low birth-weight infants decrease the incidence of more severe ROP (prethreshold ROP -- the secondary end point)?

The study has recruited approximately 400 infants, equally divided into goggle-wearing and control group. Since randomization must occur within 24 hours of birth, the investigators anticipate a mortality rate of between 10 percent and 20 percent of enrollees prior to outcome. The study is in the followup phase with regular ophthalmologic exams until either ROP regression or normal full retinal vascularization is established. A final exam occurs at adjusted age 6 months.",Interventional,"Premature infants weighing less than 1,251 grams at birth and having a gestational age of less than 31 weeks were eligible for randomization.

To identify potential risk factors for cataract development, such as age, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, height, diabetes, medication use, and history of previous eye trauma or surgery.","Cataract is one of the most common causes of impaired vision as well as the third leading cause of blindness in the United States. Cataract surgery is one of the safest and most successful of all operations. The National Eye Institute has estimated that if the progression of cataract could be slowed enough to delay the need for surgery by even 10 years, the current annual number could be reduced by 45 percent.

Little is known about the relative importance of various potential risk factors in the development of cataract. Most current information on risk factors has come from anecdotal reports or from relatively small case-control studies. One major project, the Framingham Eye Study, has identified several factors that were significantly associated with subsequent cataract formation, including diabetes and dietary factors. Diabetes has long been thought to increase the risk of developing cataract.

Recently, aspirin has been proposed as a drug that can prevent cataract formation or slow its progression. Aspirin may affect tryptophan levels in patients with cataract, or it may inhibit aldose reductase, an enzyme associated with the development of diabetic cataract. Thus, data from this study sought to determine whether one 325-mg aspirin tablet, taken on alternate days, protects against cataract formation. The data also sought to reveal other additional cataract risk factors that emerge after simultaneous controlling for other variables.

The other primary objective of this trial was to assess the antioxidant effects of beta-carotene (50 mg on alternate days) on cataract development. In addition, factors that have been suggested to be cataractogenic were assessed in prospective cohort studies. These factors included age, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, height, diabetes, medication use, cigarette smoking, and history of previous eye trauma or surgery. In addition, the possible associations between history of vitamin E and selenium intake and cataract were explored.

This trial was part of the Physicians Health Study, an ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of aspirin in the prevention of cardiovascular mortality and of beta-carotene in the prevention of cancer. Following randomization, each of the 22,071 physicians enrolled was assigned to one of four groups to take either aspirin or its placebo and beta-carotene or its placebo. Follow-up questionnaires were sent 6 and 12 months after randomization and every 12 months thereafter. The randomized aspirin component of the trial was terminated early (January 1988), after an average followup of approximately 5 years, because of a statistically extreme 44 percent reduced risk of a first myocardial infarction in the aspirin group.

Since this study is conducted by mail among physicians nationwide, examinations cannot be performed on all patients to determine when they have reached an end point. Reported diagnoses of cataract are confirmed by medical record review. The primary analysis will be of incidence of cataract in the aspirin and placebo groups. In addition, the Cox proportional hazards model will be used to determine whether there is a difference in time to cataract diagnosis between the two groups. It has been postulated that the potent antioxidant properties of beta-carotene might make it effective in preventing cataract development. The investigators will thus determine whether there is a difference in the numbers of cataracts between the beta-carotene/placebo groups and the aspirin/placebo groups.",Interventional,"The study population consisted of 22,071 male U.S. physicians, aged 40 to 84 years in 1982, with no history of myocardial infarction, cancer, kidney disease, renal disease, or any other contraindication to the use of aspirin or beta-carotene, including regular use of corticosteroids.",Accepts Healthy Volunteers,Male,40 Years,84 Years,

The Macular Photocoagulation Study (MPS) consisted of three sets of randomized, controlled clinical trials. Change in best-corrected visual acuity from baseline was the primary outcome for all MPS trials. Other measures of vision are evaluated in each set of trials. The purpose of each is described below.

Argon Study: To determine whether argon blue-green laser photocoagulation of leaking abnormal blood vessels in choroidal neovascular membranes outside the fovea (200 to 2,500 microns from the center of the foveal avascular zone [FAZ]) is of benefit in preventing or delaying loss of central vision in patients with age-related (senile) macular degeneration (AMD), presumed ocular histoplasmosis (POH), and idiopathic neovascular membranes (INVM). A separate trial was conducted for each of the three underlying conditions.

Krypton Study: To determine whether krypton red laser photocoagulation of choroidal neovascular lesions with the posterior border 1 to 199 microns from the center of the FAZ is of benefit in preventing or delaying large losses of visual acuity in patients with AMD, POH, and INVM. A separate trial was conducted for each of the three underlying conditions.

Foveal Study: To determine whether laser photocoagulation is of benefit in preventing or delaying further visual acuity loss in patients with new (never treated) or recurrent (previously treated with laser photocoagulation) choroidal neovascularization under the center of the FAZ. Two separate trials, one for each type of lesion, were carried out.","In each randomized trial conducted by the MPS Group, focal laser photocoagulation was compared to observation without treatment. Patients were assigned to laser treatment or to observation with equal probability. The first set of MPS randomized trials, the Argon Study, focused on the effectiveness of photocoagulation with argon blue-green laser in eyes with discrete extrafoveal choroidal neovascularization. The study investigators, who began recruiting patients in 1979, estimated that 550 patients with AMD and 750 with POH would be required. Follow-up was to continue for 5 years to determine whether argon laser photocoagulation treatment could prevent or delay visual acuity loss in these patients.

After the initiation of the Argon Study, a new krypton red laser became available. The new wavelength offered theoretical advantages over the argon laser for treating CNV that extended inside the FAZ of the macula. The Krypton Study design was analogous to the Argon Study, with the investigation of three underlying conditions, except that CNV was closer to the FAZ center.

The third set of MPS clinical trials, the Foveal Study, was designed to determine whether laser photocoagulation was effective for delaying or preventing further visual acuity loss in AMD patients who have subfoveal CNV. Among patients assigned to laser treatment in the Foveal Study, argon laser treatment was compared with krypton red laser treatment of these lesions. The investigators originally projected that about 350 patients would be required for each clinical trial of the Foveal Study.",Interventional,"Common Eligibility Criteria for the Argon, Krypton, and Foveal Studies:

To be eligible, men and women must have been experiencing visual symptoms attributable to the macular lesion, such as decreased visual acuity or Amsler grid distortion, at the time of entry into the study. They also must have had visible, well-demarcated hyperfluorescence characteristic of classic choroidal neovascularization on fluorescein angiography. AMD patients were 50 years of age or older and had drusen visible in the macula of at least one eye. POH patients were at least 18 years old and had at least one characteristic histo spot in one or both eyes. INVM patients were at least 18 years old and had no evidence of AMD, POH, angioid streaks, high myopia, diabetic retinopathy, or any other condition that could be the cause of the neovascularization. In particular, INVM patients had neither drusen greater than MPS Standard Photograph No. 1.1 nor histo spots in either eye.

Additional Patient Eligibility Criteria for the Argon Study:

Each patient had a visible serous detachment of the sensory retina with a diffuse area of leakage, discrete choroidal neovascularization outside the fovea (200-2,500 microns from the center of the FAZ), and visual acuity of 20/100 or better in the study eye.

Additional Patient Eligibility Criteria for the Krypton Study:

All patients had a neovascular lesion consisting of neovascularization and possibly blood and/or pigment that extended into the FAZ. The posterior border of CNV could extend as close as 1 micron to the FAZ center. Visual acuity of the study eye was 20/400 or better.

Additional Patient Eligibility Criteria for the Foveal Study:

Only patients with AMD were eligible for this study. Fluorescein angiography of the eligible eye had to show evidence of a leaking choroidal neovascular membrane, some part of which extended under the center of the FAZ, or a neovascular lesion consisting of an old laser treatment scar and contiguous leaking neovascularization within 150 microns of the center of the FAZ. New, never-treated subfoveal lesions were less than four disc areas in size. Recurrent lesions were less than six disc areas in size, including the old treatment scar and new neovascularization. Best-corrected visual acuity was no better than 20/40 and no worse than 20/320.",No,All,18 Years,,
430753,NCT00000159,NEI-61,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,Sorbinil Retinopathy Trial (SRT),October 1999,Completed,National Eye Institute (NEI),NIH,"To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug sorbinil, an aldose reductase inhibitor, in preventing the development of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy in persons with insulin-dependent diabetes.","During the last two decades, vision researchers have studied intensively the role of the enzyme aldose reductase (AR) in diabetic cataract and in other diabetic complications. The potentially damaging effects of AR in diabetes were first discovered in the lens fiber cells. In these cells, the enzyme catalyzes the reduction of high levels of glucose to sorbitol through the polyol pathway and initiates a sequence of events that eventually results in opacification of the lens. Because sorbitol (a sugar alcohol) and fructose (a subsequent product of glucose metabolism) cannot readily diffuse across cell membranes, they become trapped in lens fiber cells. There they accumulate at unusually high levels and exert a significant osmotic stress, causing an influx of water and swelling of the lens fibers. Major electrolytic and osmotic changes then occur that lead to lens opacity.

More recently, the detection of AR in the pericytes of retinal capillaries -- cells that are involved very early in the evolution of diabetic retinopathy -- suggests that this enzyme may also play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Scientists now know that AR is present in nerve tissue, and they speculate that in diabetes it induces the depletion of myo -inositol, which leads to the lessening of nerve conduction velocity in diabetic neuropathy.

Chemicals that inhibit aldose reductase have proved effective in preventing damage to the lens, in preventing thickening of retinal capillary basement membranes in diabetic animals, and in improving nerve conduction velocity values in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Therefore, it is possible that AR inhibitors also may be able to prevent, delay, or halt the development or progression of diabetic retinopathy.

To test this hypothesis, an AR inhibitor developed by Pfizer Inc., sorbinil, was studied in this clinical trial. (Other AR inhibitors underwent study in clinical trials sponsored by Ayerst and Alcon.) Initially, 402 patients were randomized into the double-masked treatment period using a dosage schedule of one 250-mg tablet daily. In 1985, recruitment was voluntarily halted by Pfizer because of several serious hypersensitivity reactions among patients taking sorbinil in clinical trials in the United States and Europe. In November 1985, recruitment resumed, using a titrated dosage schedule of 25 mg daily for 2 weeks, followed by 75 mg daily for 2 weeks, then 250 mg daily for the duration. A total of 497 patients participated in the study.

Followup visits were scheduled weekly for the first 4 weeks, monthly for the next 2 months, and every 3 months thereafter. For patients assigned to the titration protocol, additional visits were made at weeks 5 and 6. A complete history was recorded and a physical examination was conducted every 15 months; electrocardiogram was recorded every 6 months. In addition, patients were cautioned to note any signs of hypersensitivity.

Efficacy visits, scheduled at 9-month intervals after the first visit at 12 months, included fundus photographs, visual acuity examinations according to the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), red blood cell sorbitol measure, and assessment of coronary risk factor classification.

The Sorbinil Retinopathy Trial (SRT) was a unique collaboration between private industry and the Federal government in designing, funding, and conducting a multicenter, randomized clinical trial. Pfizer Inc. supported 10 of the 11 participating Clinical Centers, provided the medication, and funded the Data Coordinating Center and Fundus Photograph Reading Center. The National Eye Institute funded the Policy, Data, and Safety Monitoring Committee and its own participating Clinical Center.",Interventional,"Men and women eligible for the SRT had diabetes for 1 to 15 years and were between ages 18 and 56 at the time of enrollment.

To determine whether a difference exists in the efficacy and safety of argon versus xenon photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathy.","By the 1950s, diabetic retinopathy had become a leading cause of blindness and visual disability in the United States. The use of photocoagulation to treat proliferative retinopathy gained widespread use in ophthalmic practice following its introduction in 1959. However, only a few studies of photocoagulation incorporated any of the basic principles of controlled clinical trials, and these involved inadequate numbers of patients. Consequently, there has been inadequate evidence of the actual value of the procedure. Because of the clinical importance of diabetic retinopathy and the increasing use of photocoagulation in its management, the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) was begun in 1971. This randomized, controlled clinical trial involved more than 1,700 patients enrolled at 15 medical centers.

One eye of each patient was randomly assigned to immediate photocoagulation and the other to followup without treatment, regardless of the course followed by either eye. The eye chosen for photocoagulation was randomly assigned to either of two treatment techniques, one using an argon laser and the other a xenon arc photocoagulator. Patients were followed at 4-month intervals according to a protocol that provided for measurement of best corrected visual acuity.

Treatment was usually completed in one or two sittings and included scatter (panretinal) photocoagulation extending to or beyond the vortex vein ampulae. The argon treatment technique specified 800 to 1,600, 500-micron scatter burns of 0.1 second duration and direct treatment of new vessels whether on or within one disc diameter of the optic disc (NVD) or outside this area (NVE). Focal treatment was also applied to microaneurysms or other lesions thought to be causing macular edema. Followup treatment was applied as needed at 4-month intervals. The xenon technique was similar, but scatter burns were fewer in number, generally of longer duration, and stronger, and direct treatment was applied only to NVE on the surface of the retina.",Interventional,"Patients were eligible if they had best corrected visual acuity of 20/100 or better in each eye and the presence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in at least one eye or severe nonproliferative retinopathy in both eyes.

Approximately 3.3 million people have visual impairment due to cataract. Cataract extraction, although one of the safest and most successful of all operations, is now the most frequently performed operation in the United States among persons older than 60, costing an estimated $1.5 billion annually. AMD is the leading cause of new cases of blindness in persons aged 65 and older. Approximately 25 percent of persons aged 65 years and older have signs of AMD. The pathogenesis of AMD, however, is only partly understood, and its etiology remains obscure. For most patients, there is no available treatment. The public health burden imposed by cataract and AMD will only increase in the coming decades as the U.S. population ages.

These randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trials will test the hypotheses that supplementation with antioxidant vitamins and with low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of age-related cataract and AMD. The study populations are the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study (WACS). The WHS is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial using a 2x2 factorial design to test low-dose aspirin (100 mg on alternate days) and vitamin E (600 IU on alternate days) in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. It is being conducted among 39,876 apparently healthy female health professionals age 45 years and older. The WACS is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial using a 2x2x2x2 factorial design to test antioxidant vitamins (vitamins E [600 IU on alternate days] and C [500 mg daily], beta carotene [50 mg on alternate days]), and a combination of folate (800 mg daily), vitamin B6 (25 mg daily), and vitamin B12 (1 mg daily) among women who are at high risk for CVD morbidity and mortality. It is being conducted among 8,171 female health professionals, ages 40 years or older, who either have preexisting CVD or have at least three coronary risk factors and therefore are at high risk for the development of CVD.

In addition to the randomized comparisons, the investigators will also examine risk factors for age-related cataract and AMD in these two populations. Factors to be examined include cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, height, body mass index, diabetes, and dietary factors.

In each study population, followup questionnaires were sent at 6 and 12 months after randomization and every 12 months thereafter requesting information about development of relevant study end points including cataract and AMD and participant compliance with study medications.

Such data are needed to determine the earliest age at which surgery can be safely performed without concern that the esotropia is likely to resolve spontaneously. Although the term congenital esotropia implies that the esotropia is present at birth, in many cases the esotropia actually develops sometime during the first few months of life. It is well recognized that congenital esotropia persisting through 6 months of age rarely if ever resolves spontaneously and therefore requires surgical correction. However, it is not clear how often congenital esotropia occurs and then resolves (at an earlier age such that surgery is not necessary) before surgery is required.

Current clinical practice is to defer surgery for congenital esotropia until 6 to 12 months of age. Assuming that characteristics of congenital esotropia at 2 to 4 months of age can be identified to predict which cases will require surgery, then a trial will be warranted to determine whether performing earlier surgery enhances the development of binocular vision. The potential benefit to very early surgery is supported by neurophysiologic research, which has shown that (1) congenital esotropes may be born with the innate ability to develop binocular vision, (2) there is a critical period for development of normal binocular function within the first few months of life that is dependent on alignment of the visual axes of the two eyes, and (3) ocular misalignment alone, regardless of its mechanism, without a coexisting primary cortical fusion deficit, can account for abnormal development of binocular vision. Clinical reports have demonstrated that surgical correction of the esotropia between 6 and 12 months of age provides for enhanced development of stereoacuity compared with later surgery. However, there are limited data on the outcomes in infants who had surgical correction before age 6 months.

The protocol for the study is identical to usual clinical practice. Following informed consent, two followup visits are conducted: one 2 to 4 weeks after the first examination and the other when the child is between 28 and 32 weeks of age. The examinations will be identical to the pediatric ophthalmologist's usual routine, and no additional procedures are being performed specifically for the study. Management of refractive error and amblyopia is left to the ophthalmologist's discretion.

Most, (approximately 90 percent), of this vision loss is due to the neovascular (or wet) form of AMD. The word neovascular describes the development of new, abnormal blood vessels in the back of the eye. Unfortunately, the majority of these new vessels are not amenable to currently available treatments.

The first sign that an eye may develop AMD is the presence of drusen, yellowish deposits under the retina. Current data suggests that eyes with large drusen are at increased risk for developing the vision threatening complications of AMD. Since the 1970s investigators have reported consistently that laser photocoagulation causes a reduction in large drusen. However, results of the effects of laser treatment on preventing later complications of AMD have been less consistent and based on relatively small numbers of patients.

Further study into the ability of a treatment to prevent vision loss from the advanced forms of AMD would have profound public health implications. A treatment that could reduce the risk of developing neovascularization by 30 percent might reduce the risk of blindness from AMD by one half. The Complications of Age-related Macular Degeneration Prevention Trial (CAPT) will assess whether treating drusen by laser photocoagulation reduces the risk of loss of visual acuity.

The CAPT is a multi-center, prospective, randomized clinical trial designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of low-intensity laser treatment in preventing vision loss among patients with large drusen in both eyes. A total of 1052 participants were enrolled in the study. Participants had one eye randomly assigned to laser treatment performed by a CAPT-certified ophthalmologist. The other eye was not treated. Both eyes were observed carefully for any changes for a period of five years. The effectiveness of the treatment was assessed using the following criteria:

Change in visual acuity (primary outcome measure of the study)

Incidence of complications of AMD such as neovascularization, serous detachment of the pigment epithelium, and geographic atrophy

Changes in contrast threshold and critical print size for reading

Quality of life assessments for patients, using the Visual Function Questionnaire 25 (VFQ-25), were conducted at the time of enrollment and at 5 years.

STUDY RESULTS:

Follow-up of patients was excellent; less than 3% of visual acuity examinations were missed. At 5 years, 188 (20.5%) treated eyes and 188 (20.5%) observed eyes had visual acuity scores ≥3 lines worse than at the initial visit (p= 1.00). The cumulative 5-year incidence rates for treated and observed eyes for CNV were 13.3% and 13.3% (p=0.95), respectively; and for GA were 7.4% and 7.8% (p=0.64), respectively. The contrast threshold doubled in 23.9% of treated eyes and in 20.5% of observed eyes (p=0.40). The critical print size doubled in 29.6% of treated eyes and in 28.4% of observed eyes (p=0.70). Seven (0.7%) treated eyes and 14 (1.3%) observed eyes had an adverse event of a ≥6 -line loss in visual acuity in the absence of late age-related macular degeneration or cataract.

As applied in CAPT, low intensity laser treatment did not demonstrate a clinically significant benefit on vision in eyes of people with bilateral large drusen.",Interventional,"Patients eligible for CAPT can be either male or female and meet the following criteria:

To determine the characteristics (clinical, virologic, hematologic, and biochemical) of a population at high risk for CMV retinitis and other ocular complications of AIDS

To evaluate the effects of treatments for CMV retinitis and other ocular complications on visual function, quality of life, and survival.","Ocular abnormalities in patients with AIDS were first reported in 1982. The most common finding is a non-infectious ""HIV retinopathy"", characterized by cotton wool spots, intraretinal hemorrhages, and/or microaneurysms. These changes occur in approximately 50 percent of patients with AIDS. HIV retinopathy alone is not typically associated with clinical loss of vision, but functional deficits in patients with AIDS without other ocular complications may be due to this phenomenon.

CMV retinitis has had the most clinical importance of all the associated complications of AIDS. It is commonly seen in late stage AIDS, and even when treated has the potential to cause substantial loss of vision. CMV retinitis is also the most costly AIDS-related opportunistic infection; the mean monthly cost of treatment has been estimated at $7,825. The incidence of CMV retinitis has varied with changes in the therapeutic and prophylactic strategies for AIDS and its complications. It has been on the decline in recent years related to the increased use of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART).

Other ocular complications of AIDS such as ocular toxoplasmosis, herpes zoster retinitis, and pneumocystis choroidopathy occur less frequently than CMV retinitis and HIV retinopathy. Their frequency has also changed over the course of the AIDS epidemic.

Because the epidemiology of AIDS is rapidly evolving, with HIV becoming more like a chronic disease, new information is needed on the incidence and course of ocular complications. We have little information about the effect of HAART therapy over time on changes in immune status and the risk of ocular complications of AIDS. More information is also needed to determine who is at risk for developing ocular complications of AIDS, and how treatment is affecting their visual function, quality of life, and survival.

The Longitudinal Study of Ocular Complications of AIDS (LSOCA) is prospective observational study of patients with AIDS. Patients with a prior diagnosis of AIDS according to the 1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria with or without ocular complications will be enrolled over a 4 year period. Approximately 2,000 patients will be enrolled in the study. Enrollment of patients with CMV retinitis at baseline will be between 300 and 600 patients. Followup visits for patients without ocular complications will be scheduled every 6 months. Followup visits for patients with ocular complications at baseline or diagnosed during followup will be every 3 months. Followup data will include eye examinations, fundus photographs, visual function testing, medical history, hematology and serum chemistry, and collection of plasma and blood cells for banking.

To investigate risk factors for the development of myopia.

To conduct DNA-based studies on nearsighted children and their families.","The Orinda Longitudinal Study of Myopia (OLSM) was started in 1989 to investigate normal eye growth and the development of myopia in over 1,200 school-aged children to date. Beginning in 1997, three parallel study phases are being conducted. Phase 1 investigates additional factors that may predict the onset of juvenile myopia (accommodative function, peripheral refractive error, intraocular pressure, and school achievement). Phase 2 compares and contrasts the optical ocular components and refractive error profiles of other ethnic groups with the predominantly Caucasian Orinda database. Phase 3 conducts DNA-based studies on the prevalent OLSM myopes and their families to use these phenotypically well-characterized children and a panel of candidate genes to look for evidence of genetic factors. In parallel with the candidate gene association, family material is used in an allele sharing approach to identify loci using highly variable, PCR-based markers.

In Phase 1 we continue to examine Orinda Union School District children in grades 1 through 8 (ages 6 through 14 years) annually. The measurement of accommodative response, accommodative lag, phoria, response AC/A ratio, peripheral refractive error, and intraocular pressure will be added to the existing protocol, and photokeratoscopy and two measures of tonic accommodation will be eliminated to minimize respondent burden. Parents of children in the study will be contacted for their permission to release school achievement data (Iowa Test of Basic Skills).

Phase 2 adds a major component by adding three clinical centers to assess the influence of ethnicity on normal ocular and refractive error development. Children in these three are examined annually with initial enrollment in all grades from 1 through 8 using the revised OLSM protocol as described above.

Increased prevalence of myopia among children of myopic parents, twin studies, segregation analysis, and our own preliminary analyses from the OLSM support a genetic etiologic component for myopia. In phase 3, we use the phenotypic characterization of children in the Orinda Longitudinal Study of Myopia to identify prevalent cases of myopia and their families. These well-defined phenotypic myopes and non-myopic siblings and their parents are being explored, seeking to develop a panel of candidate genes for myopia and to conduct an allele sharing analysis in these families

The Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Ethnicity and Refractive Error (CLEERE) Study is a multi-center, observational investigation of ocular development and refractive error development in schoolchildren. It adds three clinical centers to the Orinda Longitudinal Study of Myopia (OLSM), begun in 1989, specifically to describe normal ocular growth in children ages 6 to 14 years, and to develop the ability to predict juvenile onset myopia before it is clinically evident. In addition to the more than 1,300 predominantly Caucasian children enrolled in the OLSM, three additional clinical sites enroll African-American, Hispanic, and Asian children. The children are examined annually for at least four years. Examinations include visual acuity, refraction by a variety of methods (cycloplegic autorefraction being the primary outcome measure), cover test at distance and near, accommodative response assessment with the autorefractor, response AC/A ratio measurement, videophakometry, peripheral refraction, and A-scan ultrasonography.

Primary: To determine the long-term visual acuity outcome at age 10 years and at age 15 years in patients diagnosed with amblyopia before age 7 years.
Secondary: To determine whether the long-term visual acuity outcome at age 10 years and at age 15 years differs between patients who received patching followed by best clinical care and patients who received atropine followed by best clinical care","Amblyopia, or lazy eye, is the most common cause of visual impairment in children and often persists in adulthood. It is reported to be the leading cause of vision loss in one eye in the 20-70 year old age group, with a prevalence of 1-4 percent in various studies, indicating that both improved means of detection and treatment are needed.

Most of the available data on the natural history of amblyopia and success rates of its treatment with either patching or drug therapy are retrospective and uncontrolled. Despite the common occurrence of amblyopia, there is little quality data on treatment of this condition. Thus, there is much to be learned about the course of treated amblyopia, to provide more precise estimates of success rates and to identify factors that may be associated with successful and unsuccessful treatment.

Amblyopia, when diagnosed in children, is usually treated with occlusion (patching) of the sound eye. Occlusion therapy is subject to problems of compliance, due to the child's dislike of wearing a patch for visual, skin irritation, and social/psychological reasons. There is evidence that compliance may be one of, if not, the most important determinant of success of amblyopia therapy.

An alternative treatment, drug therapy with a cycloplegic drug (atropine) that dilates the pupils and blurs the image seen by the sound eye, has been known for almost a century. This method has been widely used for the management of occlusion treatment failures and for maintenance therapy. However, it has seen little use as a primary treatment for amblyopia. Clinical experience has found that it has a high acceptability to patients and parents, and hence high compliance. In addition to its acceptability, pharmacologic therapy has the known advantage over occlusion of providing a wider visual field with both eyes, which may have safety and other functional implications. There is also clinical and laboratory evidence suggesting that drug therapy may maintain and improve the ability to see with both eyes (binocularity).

Available data suggest that the success rate with drug therapy is as good as, if not better than, the success rate with occlusion therapy for mild to moderate degrees of amblyopia. If this is true, for many children with amblyopia, drug therapy may be the preferred initial therapy since it appears to be more readily accepted by the children and parents. Despite data to support the use of drug therapy as a primary therapy for amblyopia, it has gained only limited use among pediatric ophthalmologists. A definitive study comparing the outcomes from occlusion therapy and drug therapy is justified in order to determine if new practice guidelines for treatment of amblyopia are needed.

Regardless of whether the trial determines that one therapeutic approach is better than the other, the data that are collected will provide valuable information about the course of amblyopia treatment that is not presently available. The study also is expected to provide data that will help to determine whether factors such as age, refractive status, cause of amblyopia, or fixation pattern should be considered in determining which procedure is best for a given patient.

Frequent nocturnal awakening is a common behavioral symptom of AD. Nighttime wandering and agitated behavior may result in injuries and sleep disruption for caregivers. Alternatives are sorely needed to the currently available sleep medications that have marginal efficacy and serious side effects. Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone secreted by the pineal gland. It has soporific effects with oral administration and is well tolerated. It enhances sleep in normal older people.

Results from previous clinical trials suggest that galantamine may improve cognitive performance in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. It is not a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Nerve cells in the brain responsible for memory and cognitive function communicate using a chemical called acetylcholine. Research has shown that deterioration of cells that produce acetylcholine in the brain affects thought processes. Galantamine is thought to work in two ways to increase the amount of acetylcholine available in the brain. It inhibits an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine and it also stimulates the nicotinic receptors in the brain to release more acetylcholine.,"After a 1-month single-blind run in phase, 910 subjects will be titrated, over a period of up to 8 weeks, to target doses of either: 0 (placebo); 24 mg/day galantamine; 16 mg/day galantamine; or 8 mg/day galantamine, in a 2:2:2:1 randomization ratio.

An NIA-funded study recently confirmed that MCI is different from both dementia and normal age-related changes in memory. Accurate and early evaluation and treatment of MCI individuals might prevent further cognitive decline, including development of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

The Memory Impairment Study is the first such AD prevention clinical trial carried out by NIH, and will be conducted at 65-80 medical research institutions located in the United States and Canada. This study will test the usefulness of two drugs to slow or stop the conversion from MCI to AD. The trial will evaluate placebo, vitamin E, and donepezil, an investigational agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration for another use. Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is thought to have antioxidant properties, and was shown in a 1997 study to delay important dementia milestones, such as patients' institutionalization or progression to severe dementia, by about seven months.","This clinical trial will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel-group study of vitamin E and donepezil in 720 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment groups (240 subjects per treatment group): 1) Placebo vitamin E and placebo donepezil plus a multivitamin daily. 2) Vitamin E (2,000 I) and placebo donepezil plus a multivitamin daily.3) Donepezil (10 mg) and placebo vitamin E plus a multivitamin daily.

The study will be conducted over three years, with clinical evaluations every 3 months for the first 6 months and then every 6 months. Subjects randomized to donepezil will start a dose of 5 mg daily. Donepezil will be increased to 10 mg after six weeks. Subjects randomized to vitamin E will start at 1,000 I daily. The dose of Vitamin E will be increased to 2,000 I after six weeks. There will be a 12-month recruitment period. The primary endpoint will be time to development of Probable or Possible AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. Upon determination of a clinical diagnosis of AD, documentation will be sent to the ADCS Coordinating Center and forwarded to the Central Review Committee for verification. Upon verification, of conversion to diagnosis of AD, subjects will stop taking the donepezil study medication or its corresponding placebo, without breaking the blind, and will be offered open label donepezil at a scheduled visit one month after the prior diagnostic visit. Donepezil will be offered to subjects who convert to AD until the subject completes three years from the baseline visit.

The study was a controlled pilot trial of risperidone in opiate-dependent patients on methadone maintenance.

A program to prevent suicide in elderly patients needs to be developed. Since elderly patients frequently have doctor's visits, it may be best to have a suicide prevention program based in the patient's doctor's office.

When an older person visits a primary care physician, he/she will check for signs of depression, including thoughts of suicide. The doctor will speak to the patient about depression and how to recognize it. If the individual is diagnosed with depression, the doctor will offer treatment. During this study, the information the doctor collects will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. The study will last for 2 years.

Eligibility for this study is age of at least 60 years and diagnosis of depression. (Depression required for 920 of the 1200 patients; 280 patients should have no symptoms of depression.)","To investigate the effectiveness of an intervention aimed at improving the recognition of suicidal ideation and depression in elderly patients and facilitating the implementation of a treatment algorithm based on the AHCPR (Agency for Health Care Policy and Research) guidelines. To implement procedures aimed at educating patients, families, and physicians on depression and suicidal ideation.

There is a need to test models of depression recognition and treatment to prevent and reduce suicidal behavior in older patients in primary care settings. Elderly suicide most frequently occurs in the context of mild to moderate depression. In primary care patients, suicidal ideation is a risk factor for suicide and has been identified almost exclusively in patients with depressive symptoms and signs. Since most suicide victims are seen by their primary care physicians within a few weeks prior to their death, intervening at the doctor's office may be life-saving.

The intervention is offered in 6 primary care practices from 3 geographic areas (metropolitan and suburban New York, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh) and its impact is contrasted to that of 6 comparable practices offering usual care. Patients are selected through an age-stratified, two-stage sampling design and followed for 2 years. The group consists of 1,200 subjects and is comprised of patients with depressive symptoms and signs and a random sample of patients without significant depressive symptomatology. Depression Specialists (DS) collaborate with physicians and help them increase recognition, offer timely and appropriately-targeted treatment recommendations, and encourage patients to adhere to treatment. Beyond direct systematic clinical assessment of patients, information is obtained on health services utilization from practice-based medical records and on cause of death from death certificates. Data are also collected to document the impact of intervention on patient care, and on physician knowledge, attitudes, and satisfaction and test hypotheses derived from preliminary studies of the three Intervention Research Centers (IRCs), Cornell, University of Pennsylvania, and University of Pittsburgh, where the study will be conducted.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria:

The purpose of this study is 1) to determine whether nine months of maintenance cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) significantly improves the likelihood of sustained improvement; and 2) to determine the acute acceptability and efficacy of medication therapy or continued CBT alone among patients who fail to respond sufficiently to an initial course of CBT alone.

It has been found that patients with PD respond as well to CBT or medication alone as they do to a combination of the two. Since the combined treatments are expensive and CBT is associated with less risk of medical toxicity compared to medications, CBT alone will be used first.

All patients will first receive CBT alone. If the patient responds to this therapy, the patient will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. One group will continue to receive CBT (maintenance therapy) for 9 months. The other group of responders will not receive any further therapy. If a patient does not respond to CBT alone, he/she will be assigned randomly to 1 of 2 different groups. One group will receive paroxetine; the other will continue to receive CBT for a longer period. The response to treatment will be evaluated to see which regimen works best to treat PD. The study will last approximately 3 years.

For those who do not respond sufficiently to CBT alone, to determine if the addition of pharmacotherapy is acceptable and if this improves response among those inadequate responders to CBT alone.

This multicenter study builds upon the findings of a prior study comparing imipramine, placebo, CBT, and their combination in the treatment of PD patients with no more than mild agoraphobia. That study found response rates were as high with CBT or imipramine alone as with their combination. Given the added cost of combined treatments, it therefore seems reasonable to begin with monotherapy. Further, following general principles of medical practice, it would be reasonable to initiate treatment with the less invasive cognitive behavioral intervention. It is then important to learn what should be done following initial treatment.

All patients initially receive CBT alone. Patients are then randomized into 1 of 2 post-acute studies, depending on response status. Responders are randomized to a maintenance study comparing no maintenance with 9 months of continued CBT. Nonresponders are randomized to a study comparing paroxetine with continued CBT.

Psychologists have found that treating patients for their fear of public speaking, through cognitive-behavioral treatment (talk-based therapy) or exposure treatment (where participants participate in actual public speaking sessions), not only helps patients overcome this fear but also helps them overcome their more general social fears. However, little is known about how this change occurs during therapy. This study tries to identify the factors that contribute most to successful therapy.

Patients are assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to 1 of 3 groups. Group 1 will receive cognitive-behavioral treatment and Group 2 will receive exposure treatment. Group 3 will not receive treatment. Study leaders will monitor patient response to treatment through behavioral tests and assessments.

Perceived self-efficacy of social behavior, negative cognitive appraisal (estimated social costs), and perceived emotional control will be considered as potential mediators; avoidant personality disorder and the generalized subtype of social phobia will be considered as potential predictors for poor treatment outcome.

Social phobia is a very prevalent and debilitating disorder, with public speaking anxiety being the most common fear among socially phobic individuals. Although there are a number of effective psychosocial treatments for social phobia (e.g., cognitive-behavioral treatments and exposure therapy) very little is known about the underlying mechanism of therapeutic change (i.e., the mediators of change), and the variables that are predictive of treatment outcome (i.e., the moderators of change). Furthermore, it is unclear why treating individuals for their public speaking anxiety can generalize to other untreated social fears.

Patients are randomly assigned to either a comprehensive cognitive-behavioral treatment for social phobia (n=43), a performance-based exposure treatment for public speaking anxiety without cognitive intervention (n=43), or a waitlist control group (n=43). Clinician ratings, behavioral tests, cognitive assessments, subjective ratings, and physiological measures are employed to determine the degree of therapeutic gains in various social phobia domains.

Clozapine is currently the most effective treatment for negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Two other drugs, D-cycloserine and glycine, are being investigated as new treatments. D-cycloserine improves negative symptoms when added to some drugs, but may worsen these symptoms when given with clozapine. Glycine also improves negative symptoms and may still be able to improve these symptoms when given with clozapine. This study gives either D-cycloserine or glycine (or an inactive placebo) with clozapine to determine which is the best combination.

Patients will be assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Group 1 will receive D-cycloserine plus clozapine. Group 2 will receive glycine plus clozapine. Group 3 will receive an inactive placebo plus clozapine. Patients will receive these medications for 8 weeks. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia will be monitored through the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, Positive symptoms will be monitored through the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and additionally subjects will complete the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Global Assessment Scale.

An individual may be eligible for this study if he/she is 18 to 65 years old and has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.","To determine if glycine produces improvement in negative symptoms and D-cycloserine produces worsening in symptoms compared to placebo, patients will undergo a double blind study of d-cycloserine and glycine treatment added to clozapine.

Clozapine is more effective for negative symptoms of schizophrenia than conventional neuroleptics, but the neurochemical actions contributing to this superior clinical efficacy remain unclear. Recent evidence points to a role for glutamatergic dysregulation in schizophrenia, as well as important differences between conventional agents and clozapine in effects upon glutamatergic systems. D-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glycine modulatory site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, improves negative symptoms when added to conventional agents and worsens negative symptoms when added to clozapine. High-dose glycine also improves negative symptoms and has provided preliminary evidence suggesting that glycine improves negative symptoms when added to clozapine. Serum concentrations of glycine predicted response to both high-dose glycine and D-cycloserine. Both clozapine and D-cycloserine may improve negative symptoms by activation of the glycine modulatory site of the NMDA receptor complex. Because D-cycloserine is a partial agonist, it may act as an antagonist at the glycine site in the presence of clozapine, whereas the full agonist, glycine, would not be expected to worsen negative symptoms in the presence of clozapine.

This study proposes to administer a fixed-dose of D-cycloserine, glycine, or placebo added to clozapine in 45 patients with schizophrenia. Because assessments are standardized between studies, results from this study can be compared with results from a previous study of D-cycloserine added to conventional neuroleptic.

Long-term studies of first-episode schizophrenia patients have clearly indicated excellent initial responsiveness of positive psychotic symptoms to treatment with conventional antipsychotic medications. However, in the years immediately following this initial good response, morbidity increases. Relapses, often multiple ones, are the rule and are usually precipitated by medication noncompliance. There is some evidence that the second-generation antipsychotic drugs may have superior efficacy in terms of these outcome domains. However, these newer agents have been studied primarily in chronic and/or treatment-resistant patient samples and there are virtually no long-term studies or studies comparing the new drugs with one another.

First episode patients are randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine or risperidone for 3 years. Outcome measures for the initial episode include psychopathology (positive, negative, and affective symptoms), side effects, neurocognition (executive function, memory, and attention), social and occupational function and service utilization.

Patients will either continue to receive ECT (continuation electroconvulsive therapy [C-ECT]), or they will be treated with antidepressant medications.

ECT is a highly effective treatment for MDD; however, relapses are a major concern. To prevent relapse in patients who have responded to ECT, the common treatment is antidepressants as continuation therapy (following the initial therapy in order to continue treating the disorder). Relapses, however, can still occur even after antidepressant continuation therapy. This study will evaluate a potent antidepressant combination in order to prevent relapse. C-ECT is another option that needs to be tested.

If the patient responds to the first round of ECT, he/she will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to either continue receiving ECT or to receive an antidepressant combination of nortriptyline plus lithium (NOR-Li) for 6 months. The patient will have psychological tests before, shortly after, and 3 months after the first round of ECT, and at the end of the 6-month continuation trial.

To determine the relative efficacy and safety of C-ECT in comparison to the traditional approach of continuation pharmacotherapy (C-PHARM) to prevent relapses of MDD.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for MDD that is helpful for patients with the most severe forms of affective illness; however, relapse after successful acute phase ECT or pharmacotherapy remains a major public health problem. To prevent relapse in patients with MDD who have responded to ECT, the common practice is to prescribe an antidepressant (e.g., a tricyclic [TCA], a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI], or lithium) as continuation therapy. Recent studies show an alarmingly high relapse rate after ECT despite conventional continuation pharmacotherapy (C-PHARM). Continuation ECT (C-ECT) is also in widespread clinical use; however, its efficacy and safety have never been rigorously tested.

Investigators at four sites (Mayo Clinic, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Zucker Hillside Hospital, and University of Texas SW Medical Center, Dallas) randomize patients to receive either C-ECT or an aggressive pharmacological strategy (nortriptyline and lithium in combination, [NOR-Li]) for 6 months following response to acute phase ECT. Raters at each site evaluate symptoms and side effects. On the basis of edited videotapes obtained at regular intervals, a site-independent, blinded evaluator also assesses symptoms. A neuropsychological battery is administered prior to acute phase ECT, shortly after the ECT course, 3 months after the end of the acute phase treatment, and at the end of the 6-month continuation trial. These continuation therapies are compared in their effects on relapse, cognitive performance, global functioning, side effects, and perceived health status.

The following are assessed: differences in recurrence rates and time to recurrence under full-dose vs half-dose conditions; differences in symptomatic ratings of depression, suicidal ideation, social adjustment, and side effects; and differences in compliance rates as determined by variability in level-to-dose (L/D) ratios. Exploratory data analyses are used to generate a hypothetical profile of elderly patients who can remain well on half-dose maintenance nortriptyline.

SSRIs are effective in the treatment of major depression. However, there is also evidence that SSRIs may be significantly less effective than TCAs for patients with late-life major depression with melancholia. Since SSRIs seem to be easier to take than TCAs and are more widely prescribed, it is important to determine which of these types of antidepressants works best to treat these patients.

Patients will be assigned randomly to receive either sertraline (a SSRI) or nortriptyline (a TCA) for 12 weeks. Patients will be monitored for symptoms, side effects, and quality of life. If a patient responds to treatment, he/she will participate in a 6-month continuation phase in which he/she will continue to receive the same medication.

An individual may be eligible for this study if he/she:

To test the hypothesis that medication condition interacts with diagnostic subtype (melancholic vs non-melancholic) in determining antidepressant response. To examine the roles of symptom severity and alternative diagnostic subtyping in contributing to this pattern.

SSRIs are effective in the treatment of major depression. However, there is also evidence that SSRIs may be significantly less effective than TCAs for depressed patients with melancholia. This issue is of particular concern in late-life major depression. SSRIs have important safety advantages with respect to overdose and a benign cardiovascular profile. Furthermore, the SSRIs do not have significant anticholinergic effects, and appear to be better tolerated than the TCAs. Perhaps most important, the SSRIs currently are prescribed widely as the medication treatment of first choice for major depression in late life. Therefore, if it were determined that SSRIs are considerably less effective than TCAs in the treatment of melancholia in the elderly, there would be significant ramifications for clinical practice.

Randomization to sertraline (a SSRI) or nortriptyline (a TCA) is stratified by the presence or absence of melancholia. Outcome measures for the 12-week acute phase include clinician and patient ratings of symptoms, side effects, and an evaluation of the health-related quality of life (HRQOL).

There are a variety of therapies used to treat PTSD, but the effectiveness of medication alone vs an exposure treatment, such as EMDR, has not been tested.

Patients will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to one of three groups for 8 weeks of treatment. Group 1 will receive fluoxetine; Group 2 will receive EMDR; and Group 3 will receive inactive placebo.

To clarify: 1) the differential treatment effects of these different treatment modalities; 2) whether symptom improvement is accompanied by changes in pathophysiology; and 3) the long-term effectiveness of these treatments.

In recent years a variety of treatment approaches have been shown to be effective in the treatment of PTSD. These include prolonged exposure therapies (PE), stress inoculation training (SIT), EMDR and psychopharmacological treatment with serotonin re-uptake blockers. While PE has been compared with SIT and a study is currently under way comparing cognitive-behavioral treatment with EMDR, no study as yet has compared the relative merits of pharmacotherapy alone vs an exposure treatment. While it is commonly held that, in order to recover, people with PTSD need to ""process"" their traumatic memories, treatments that do not involve the processing of traumatic memories (such as SIT or pharmacotherapy) may be just as effective. In clinical practice, many patients with PTSD appear to be effectively treated with pharmacological agents alone, without trauma-focused therapy.

Patients are randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1) a double-blind psychopharmacological treatment (fluoxetine); 2) a manualized treatment which focuses on ""processing"" traumatic memories (EMDR); or 3) a placebo control group. After 8 weeks of active treatment, subjects are evaluated, cease treatment, and are assessed again after another 8 weeks and at 6 months in order to evaluate the long-term effects. Training raters remain blind to the subjects' treatment condition throughout the study.

Nearly 40% of the geriatric population complain of poor sleep quality, a complaint that is validated by objective findings. The physiological consequences of age-impaired sleep are poorly understood, but may include damped circadian rhythms and impaired anabolic hormone status. Poor sleep may also account for the disproportionate prescription of sedative hypnotics to older adults which may exacerbate sleep apnea, lead to daytime carryover effects such as sedation, falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, and anterograde amnesia, and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The recent NIH Consensus Conference on the Treatment of Sleep Disorders in Older People concluded that nonsedative interventions to improve sleep quality in the elderly population are obviously needed. One such intervention may be stimulation of the GH-IGF-1 axis by GHRH administration. Clinical evidence indicates sleep quality can be affected by extremes of GH status and several recent studies report acute GHRH administration improves sleep quality in young men.

Anxiety disorders are one of the most common psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents, and can cause disturbances in the child's school, social, and family lives.

Aim 2 is to test specific hypotheses about predictors, mediators, and moderators of long-term outcome among children with ADHD (e.g., comorbidity; family functioning; cognitive skills; peer relations) that may influence adolescent functioning (either independent of or through initial treatment assignment and/or 14-month treatment outcomes); and to compare how these predictors, mediators, and moderators are similar or dissimilar within the normal comparison group. Aim 3 is to track the patterns of risk and protective factors (including their mediation or moderation by initial treatment assignment and/or outcome) involved in early and subsequent stages of developing substance-related disorders and antisocial behavior. Aim 4 is to examine the effect of initial treatment assignment and degree of treatment success on later academic performance, achievement, school conduct, tendency to drop out, and other adverse school outcomes.

In the original MTA design, patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment conditions: (1) medication only; (2) psychosocial only; (3) combined (medication and psychosocial); or (4) Assessment-and-Referral condition. All but the latter were treated intensively for 14 months, with assessments for all subjects at baseline, 3, 9, 14, and 24 months. The original MTA design thus provides short-term (10 months post-treatment) follow-up at 24 months.

Studies have shown that AIDS is caused by a retrovirus. This virus works by inactivating or destroying human CD4 cells (which are part of the human immune system). This in turn leads to the observed immunologic defects and related illnesses, including HIV encephalopathy (disease of the brain). One method of preventing AIDS is to prevent HIV from entering the cell. HIV binds to the receptor CD4 site. Peptide T also binds to this site, and thus by competing for that site, can block the binding of the virus to its receptor. Preliminary animal and human studies indicate that peptide T is safe at the doses selected for this trial.

(High doses of methotrexate are used to treat some types of cancer.) Methotrexate blocks the action of the B-vitamin known as folic acid. We are studying the biochemical reactions affected by this vitamin because we think that blocking many of these reactions may be necessary for methotrexate to work in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Through these studies, we hope to gain a better understanding of how this drug and related drugs work as treatments for arthritis.","Low-dose methotrexate therapy suppresses autoimmune arthritis in human and animal models. We hypothesize that the effect of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is due to the inhibition of aminoimidazole-carboxamide ribotide transformylase, a folate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the last step in the de novo biosynthesis of inosine monophosphate. The resulting accumulation of aminoimidazole carboxamide riboside inhibits adenosine deaminase, therefore interfering with normal adenosine metabolism. It is well known that children with adenosine deaminase deficiency have severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome. This suggests that adenosine deaminase activity is key to immune competence and is associated with the mechanism of efficacy in methotrexate therapy of rheumatoid arthritis.

Several studies indicate that supplemental folinic acid (5-formyltetrahydrofolate) used in large doses during low-dose methotrexate therapy for rheumatoid arthritis causes a flare in joint inflammation. However, supplemental folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid) does not lessen the efficacy of the therapy. We further hypothesize that if methotrexate efficacy is driven by aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide transformylase inhibition, folic acid supplementation should not alter urinary levels of aminoimidazole carboxamide, adenosine, and deoxyadenosine, while folinic acid supplementation should prevent the accumulation of these compounds.

We will test our hypotheses both in people with rheumatoid arthritis and in Lewis rat adjuvant arthritis. Our objectives include: (1) determining if the dose level of methotrexate that is clinically optimal in the treatment of Lewis rat adjuvant arthritis interferes with normal adenosine metabolism; (2) determining the effectiveness of drugs that interfere with adenosine metabolism (deoxycoformycin, aminoimidazole carboxamide, and aminoimidazole carboxamide with a suboptimal dose of methotrexate) in Lewis rat adjuvant arthritis; and (3) determining whether supplemental folic acid and folinic acid during methotrexate therapy normalize adenosine metabolism in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

We will gather participants for this project through a faith-based community network.

The treatment is a type of psychotherapy called cognitive-behavioral therapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapy combines cognitive therapy, which can modify or eliminate thought patterns contributing to the person's symptoms, and behavioral therapy, which aims to help the person change his or her behavior.","Fibromyalgia (FM) is a prevalent and debilitating condition that contributes to impaired occupational and social functioning and increased disability among affected individuals. The vast majority of people with FM experience persistent sleep disturbances (e.g., onset difficulty, repeated or extended awakenings, nonrestorative sleep) that worsen other FM-related symptoms (e.g., chronic pain, fatigue) and sustain their general dysfunction. Pharmacologic treatments (e.g., antidepressants, hypnotics) may reduce symptoms for some people with FM, but many FM patients display little enduring improvement in their sleep and other FM-related symptoms in response to such agents.

Our clinical observations and initial pilot work suggest that factors common among other insomnia subtypes such as conditioned bedtime arousal, erratic sleep/wake scheduling, and spending too much time in bed likely perpetuate the sleep problems of these medication-refractory FM patients. Over the past decade, we have developed, refined, and repeatedly tested a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that has proven effective for reducing sleep disturbances perpetuated by such underlying cognitive/behavioral mechanisms. The major objectives of this project are to conduct a prospective randomized clinical trial to confirm these preliminary findings and to determine the efficacy of CBT insomnia treatment for interrupting the disturbed nocturnal sleep and daytime pain, fatigue, and distress symptom complex that defines FM.

One arm of this study's three-by-four factorial design will compare CBT with both a contact control treatment and standard care. The other arm in the design is a repeated-measures factor consisting of four time points (i.e., baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up periods) at which we will assess outcome. We will assess participants at all four time points with objective (wrist actigraphy) and subjective (sleep logs, Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire) measures of sleep improvements, measures of subjective pain, and questionnaires that assess mood (State-Trait Anxiety and Beck Depression Scales) and general quality of life (SF-36). We will conduct multivariate statistical analyses and tests of clinical significance with these various measures. We will also conduct exploratory analyses to determine if polysomnographically-derived sleep measures obtained prior to treatment correlate with initial levels of pain and distress or eventual treatment outcome.

Results should provide information about the usefulness of CBT for treating FM-related sleep difficulties. Results should also improve understanding of the FM syndrome in general and provide new information about the potential role of behavioral therapy in the overall management of this disorder.

This study will evaluate the effects of two of the most promising nondrug treatments for FM: coping skills training and physical exercise training. We will randomly assign each of 180 patients diagnosed with FM to one of four groups: coping skills training (CST), physical exercise training alone, CST plus physical exercise training, or a waiting list (nontreatment group). We will look at the separate and combined effects of CST and physical exercise training and evaluate how changes in aerobic fitness, self-effectiveness (a person's belief in his or her ability to reach a goal, such as managing one's own disease), and negative pain-related thoughts relate to improvements in pain and disability.","Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal pain, discrete tender points at typical soft-tissue sites, fatigue, stiffness, and sleep problems. Of these symptoms, pain is often the primary concern of FM patients and their physicians. Traditional medical approaches to managing FM have limitations (side effects) and have not been effective in managing pain. Given these limitations, treatments that involve nonpharmacologic interventions may represent a valuable addition to patient care. This study will evaluate the effects of two of the most promising nonpharmacologic interventions for FM: coping skills training (CST) for pain management and physical exercise training.

(Bone mineral density affects bone strength and the risk of osteoporosis.) Six groups of about 300 women each participated in this osteoporosis prevention study. In 1998, the BEST study received additional funding to examine for another 2 years the long-term effects of strength training on bone mineral density. By 2001 we will have finished analyzing the results for all study groups on the 1-year effects of exercise on bone, as well as additional analyses on the effects of 2, 3, and 4 years of strength training and weight-bearing exercise on bone.","Osteoporotic fractures associated with low bone mineral density (BMD) are a significant public health problem for women, resulting in over 1 million fractures per year. The increasing incidence of fractures will make an already major health problem an even greater one in the future. Estimates of medical costs for the treatment of osteoporotic fractures are expected to increase from $14.8 billion in 1995 to $60 billion by 2020. Although the Women's Health Initiative is investigating dietary and hormonal factors in relation to bone density, it is not investigating the effects of exercise on reducing bone mineral loss in postmenopausal women.

This study includes completion of a large, partially randomized clinical trial evaluating the effect of a 1-year exercise intervention on total body and regional BMD in two populations (hormone replacement therapy [HRT] versus no HRT) of postmenopausal women with a previous history of physical inactivity. A major hypothesis is that, compared to the no-exercise group, the exercise intervention will be an effective alternative to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and the exercise effects will be larger in the cohort of women on HRT than those not on HRT.

The exercise program includes progressive resistance exercises using free weights and weight resistance machines and weight-bearing aerobic exercises. We carefully supervise and monitor the exercise compliance by keeping records of the amount of exercise completed at each of three weekly exercise sessions and by measuring strength gains of selected muscle groups. We will measure biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption and hormonal correlates of bone mineral density changes including sex steroids at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year.

We have obtained duplicate blood collections, made one week apart, for all cohorts at each of the three measurement periods. We have also collected duplicate dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans at each time period to follow changes in axial and appendicular BMD and total and regional soft tissue body composition as a result of the intervention. We collected extensive dietary intake records during the first year of intervention; we will monitor dietary intake in a 2-year followup using food frequency questionnaires. We will also measure followup BMD, soft tissue, and lean and fat body composition for 2 years in all women who complete the first-year intervention program.

Two-hundred sixty-six women have completed the first year of the intervention. The study has a retention rate of 92 percent in the first year for the first four cohorts.

Because of the paucity of information regarding long-term effects of exercise, and because of the increased emphasis in the scientific community on evaluating the long-term efficacy of exercise interventions for osteoporosis prevention, this comprehensive 1-year clinical trial and 2-year followup will make an important contribution to determining the future role of combining progressive resistance and weight bearing aerobic exercise in the prevention of osteoporosis in two populations (HRT vs. no HRT) of postmenopausal women.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria:

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most popular agents used to treat OA, but elderly women, in whom OA is especially common, are at greatest risk of developing serious side effects from NSAIDs.

Our study targets overweight middle-aged women who have OA in one knee. Half of the 432 study participants will receive the treatment (doxycycline) and half will receive a placebo (inactive pill). Treatment with doxycycline (or placebo) will last 30 months, and participants and researchers will not know who is receiving doxycycline and who is receiving placebo until the end of the study.

We will also use questionnaires to evaluate participants' symptoms and functioning.","This study is a double-blind, multicenter randomized controlled trial of doxycycline on osteoarthritis (OA) progression. Our previous research suggests that doxycycline might help prevent or slow OA development by reducing breakdown of cartilage in joints. The target population is one that is at high risk for the development of bilateral knee OA: overweight middle-aged women with unilateral knee OA at baseline. We hypothesize that doxycycline will decrease the severity or rate of progression of OA. We are recruiting 432 study participants across six clinical centers and randomizing them to treatment or placebo groups (N=216/group).

People who participate in the study will receive care for knee OA for 1 year. We will measure the results (outcomes) of treatment at the start of the study and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after patients join the study. The results we will measure include joint pain, physical function, drug side effects, quality of life, satisfaction with OA care, and the cost of medical care.","Anticipating trends toward generalism in medicine, the rheumatology community has begun to set forth guidelines for managing osteoarthritis (OA). These guidelines emphasize a comprehensive approach toward nondrug treatment (e.g., patient education, exercise, social support) and a conservative approach to drug management to minimize the side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Unfortunately, few primary care physicians provide conservative, comprehensive care for OA as promoted in the recent rheumatology literature. Also, although researchers have studied individual elements of a comprehensive approach to OA care and largely validated them in isolation, no research support exists to suggest that uniformly adopting OA care guidelines will result in better patient outcomes and/or reduced costs of care.

In this project, we will implement, in a controlled fashion, and evaluate a comprehensive plan for treating patients with knee OA by primary care physicians in a managed care environment. Comprehensive care for knee OA will be guided by a procedure designed to introduce and reinforce (a) an array of nondrug, self-care procedures intended to combat joint pain and preserve function and (b) a stepped protocol for drug management of knee pain that minimizes the risk of adverse side effects of NSAIDs.

We will also look at the effects of gradually stopping the jumping program on bone mass in the growing skeleton. A high-impact exercise program may build more bone during childhood, while the skeleton is still growing. This may help prevent broken bones due to loss of bone mass later in life.

We will recruit 200 children aged 5-10 to participate in the study. For 6 months we will train the children in either a jumping or stretching program. We will then gradually reduce the amount of exercise over 6 months. We will measure bone mass in the hip and backbone at the start of the study, after jumping, and 6 months after the jumping program is stopped. We will compare the results in the jumping and stretching groups.","Osteoporotic fractures are increasing at an alarming rate in this country and result in over 13 billion dollars in health costs annually. Peak bone mass, that is, an individual's maximum bone mass at the completion of skeletal acquisition, is an important determinant of fracture risk. Thus, maximizing peak bone mass may provide an effective strategy for preventing osteopenia and osteoporosis.

Various investigators have postulated that increasing bone mass by 3-5 percent would reduce fracture risk by 20-30 percent. Our data in collegiate female gymnasts demonstrate hip and spine bone mineral density values of up to 40 percent above values in normal age-matched controls and elite runners, despite menstrual irregularities. Further, we have observed the dynamic response of bone to high-impact forces in gymnasts over the training season as bone increases of 2-5 percent.

This is a randomized, controlled exercise intervention designed to evaluate the effect of high-impact loading as a means to increase bone mass during development. It will determine bone mass accrual and bone geometry at the lumbar spine and proximal femur in prepubescent girls and boys. Further, this study will evaluate the bone response from withdrawal of the stimulus over 6 months.

We will recruit 200 pre-pubescent children during two separate years and randomly assign them to a jumping or a stretching group. The jumping group will perform double leg jumps and the stretching group will act as a control. Outcome variables include bone mineral density (BMD) at the spine and hip, estimated bone volumetric density at the spine, and cross-sectional geometry of the femoral neck and diaphysis.

Implementing a specific bone-loading program during childhood will potentially allow the bone to increase both its mass and mineralization at an earlier age and therefore provide a larger foundation of mineralization for further growth throughout adolescence until skeletal maturity is reached. We expect our findings to provide a basis for the design of strategies to build bone during growth and thereby reduce osteoporotic fractures.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria:

Despite these trends, there is little evidence proving the effectiveness of these therapies over nonsurgical management.

This study will use the National Spine Network to conduct a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial for the three most common diagnostic groups for which spine surgery is performed: lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (IDH), spinal stenosis (SpS), and spinal stenosis secondary to degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS). This arm of the trial will deal with patients from the third diagnostic group. The study will compare the most commonly used standard surgical treatments to the most commonly used standard nonsurgical treatments. We will conduct the study at 12 sites throughout the United States.

The primary endpoint of the study will be changes in health-related quality of life as measured by the SF-36 health status questionnaire. Secondary endpoints will include patient satisfaction with treatment, utility for current health in order to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYS) as the measure for cost-effectiveness, resource use, and cost.

Girls in this age group are adding large amounts of new bone to their skeletons. Adding more bone at this time of life can reduce a person's chances of developing osteoporosis (thinning bones) in later years.

We will look at how this osteoporosis prevention program affects the amount of calcium in the girls' diets, the amount of weight-bearing exercise they do, and their bone mass measured using ultrasound testing of the heel.","The study's objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of a behavioral/educational intervention in increasing levels of dietary calcium intake and weight-bearing exercise within an at-risk population in a stage of rapid accrual of bone mass-specifically, premenarchal girls between the ages of 10 and 12. We will use cluster randomization to randomize girls to either the intervention or a program of education only. We will randomize eighteen groups of girls into each arm of the study.

The intervention consists of six interactive sessions using various media (i.e., overhead transparencies, graphics, and three-dimensional demonstrations) to present instructional material. Topics include an explanation of osteoporosis and its modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors, prevention of osteoporosis via healthy food choices (i.e., high calcium, low fat foods), and prevention of osteoporosis via weight-bearing exercise. Each girl monitors her own progress toward the goal of 1350 to 1500 milligrams of calcium per day. A similar method allows simple self-monitoring of weight-bearing activity. The intervention program is reinforced via monthly self-monitoring for 18 months. The education-only program consists of six generic sessions on healthy eating, physical fitness, and healthy lifestyle choices.

The primary outcomes of interest are higher calcium intake and higher levels of weight-bearing exercise.

The first, the Arthritis Self-Management Program, is a 6-week, community-based program taught in small groups by peer leaders. The second, the Self-Managed Arthritis Relief Therapy (SMART) Program, is a computer-driven program delivered through the mail. Participants in this project are people with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis who are taking part in the larger long-term studies being conducted by ARAMIS (the Arthritis, Rheumatism and Aging Medical Information System).","In a changing health care environment, the role of patients in managing their arthritis is increasingly important. Patient education is the primary means for teaching patients how to fulfill this role successfully.

These programs represent a new treatment for arthritis.

This project will evaluate the relative effect on health status and cost-effectiveness of two arthritis patient education programs that use different delivery systems. The Arthritis Self-Management Program (ASMP) uses a small group, multi-class format. It is taught by trained lay leaders and has been evaluated for effectiveness and widely disseminated. The Self-Managed Arthritis Relief Therapy (SMART) Program is a computer-driven, individualized, mail-delivered intervention. Results of a pilot study suggest that it is effective in improving health status and reducing health care use.

The project will also evaluate how generalizable the SMART program is and its effectiveness for patients with different diagnoses (OA and RA). It will also determine the attributes of patients who choose and do not choose to participate in patient education programs as well as the attributes of those who complete and do not complete the ASMP and SMART programs.

Through use of the ARAMIS data collection system, the project allows us to describe the differences between people who volunteer to receive patient education and those who refuse patient education.

However, studies in adults show that physical activity and increased calcium intake cause noticeable benefits for bone health only when both factors occur together. The goal of this study is to find out whether calcium intake changes the response of bone to activity in children 3 to 4 years old. Children will participate in one of two programs conducted in childcare centers 5 days a week for 1 year. One program will involve activities that use large muscles (gross motor activity). The other will involve activities using small muscles (fine motor activity). We will give a calcium supplement (1 gram per day) to half of the children in each program and give the other half an inactive pill. We will measure bone mass and bone mineral density at the beginning and end of the study. We will take measurements 12 months after the program's completion to see if physical activity and/or calcium supplements have long-term effects on bone mineral density and physical activity.","Participation in daily physical activity programs by young children is currently recommended as a means of promoting bone health. Results from studies of adults indicate that beneficial effects of either physical activity or calcium (Ca) intake may be apparent only when both these factors are present. Our results in infants indicate that physical activity combined with a low Ca diet may be detrimental in terms of bone mass accretion. The overall objective of this study is to determine whether Ca intake modifies the bone response to activity in young children 3 to 4 years of age.

Our hypotheses are that (1) the increase in bone mass resulting from a physical activity program will be more pronounced in children randomized to receive a Ca supplement compared to the increase in children randomized to receive a placebo; and (2) 12 months after cessation of the activity program, bone mass will remain higher in children randomized to gross motor activity compared to children randomized to fine motor activity, and the beneficial effect of Ca supplementation will persist only among children randomized to gross motor activity. We will test these hypotheses in a randomized 2 x 2 factorial trial in 3- to 4-year-old children. We will randomize children into either a gross motor or fine motor activity program that will be conducted in childcare centers 5 days a week for 1 year. We will further randomize each child into either a Ca supplement (1 g/d) or placebo group.

The primary outcomes of the study are bone mass accretion and changes in bone mineral density, which we will determine by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at the beginning and end of the study. We will do activity assessments throughout the study period to determine whether participation in the gross motor activity group also increases spontaneous activity in these children. Anthropometric measurements and dietary information will allow us to statistically control for these potential confounders. We will obtain additional bone mass and physical activity measurements 12 months after completion of the program to determine if these interventions have long-term effects on bone mineral density and physical activity.

A finding of beneficial effects of Ca supplementation or physical activity, either independent of each other or in combination, will lay the groundwork for devising prevention strategies within the educational system that optimize bone health beginning early in life. However, we may find that increased physical activity in the presence of a low to moderate Ca intake may have a detrimental effect on bone mass accretion during periods of rapid growth.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria:

We will determine this by looking at the effects of oral contraceptives (birth control pills, also known as ""the pill"") on disease activity and severity in women with SLE. The results of the study will show whether it is safe for women with SLE to use the pill.","This study tests the effect of exogenous female hormones on disease activity and severity in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Physicians generally do not prescribe oral contraceptives (OCs) to women with lupus because of the widely held view that these drugs can activate SLE. This practice is based on the greater incidence of SLE in women than in men, biologic abnormalities of estrogen metabolism, murine models of lupus, several anecdotes of patients having disease flares while receiving exogenous hormones, and a single retrospective study in patients with preexisting renal disease.

By contrast, recent retrospective studies suggest that the rate of flare is not significantly increased in patients taking OCs. The preexisting data is insufficient to warrant the dismissal of a potentially important birth control option in a disease that predominantly affects women in their reproductive years and whose fertility is not altered by the disease. Moreover, the use of OCs to preserve fertility in patients taking cyclophosphamide and the use of estrogens to prevent coronary artery disease and postmenopausal and steroid-induced osteoporosis are timely considerations.

We will attempt to define, in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the effect of OCs containing low-dose synthetic estrogens and progestins on disease activity in women with SLE. Because the research hypothesis is that OCs do not increase the risk of flares, we have designed the study to be able to detect minimal increases in the rate of flares in patients taking OCs.

We will enroll patients with inactive, stable, or moderate disease requiring less than 0.5 mg prednisone per kg of bodyweight per day over a 2-year period and randomize them to receive birth control pills or placebo pills for 12 months. During that time, the patient must use condoms or a diaphragm as birth control.

We will examine the levels of a blood protein known as C3a in a series of patient blood samples to see if C3a levels predict lupus flares or are better than other blood tests, and therefore should be used more widely in managing lupus. In the second part of the study we will add or increase prednisone treatment on the basis of abnormalities in blood tests for C3a and dsDNA antibodies. Early treatment based on increases in C3a and dsDNA antibodies, before the patient develops physical signs of disease, may reduce lupus flares and, ultimately, the patient's total steroid exposure.

We will follow study participants for 1 year on a monthly basis and do full physical examinations and laboratory evaluations. If C3a and dsDNA antibody levels are increased significantly above baseline levels while a patient is clinically stable, we will give the patient either prednisone or an inactive pill (placebo) for 1 month. We will follow these patients monthly to compare how often lupus flares occur in the two groups. This approach could provide a novel method of preventing lupus flares, using C3a as a sensitive predictor of flare.","In lupus, serial evaluation of dsDNA antibody titers and complement (C3 and C4) in blood samples have been useful in assessing disease activity in patients. High levels of C3a, a split product of C3, are particularly sensitive and reflective of lupus flares. Our study looks at whether elevations in C3a can predict lupus flares and how C3a compares with other conventional blood indicators such as dsDNA antibody, C3, C4, and CH50. The utility of serial anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement measurements in clinical decision-making for people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains controversial. This study has two specific parts designed to address these issues.

In the first, we will take advantage of a unique opportunity to collaborate with a large, multicenter NIH-sponsored protocol, the Safety of Estrogens in Systemic Lupus National Assessment (SELENA) trial. We will perform an observational study of approximately 1,000 women enrolled in the SELENA trial to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of anti-dsDNA antibodies, C3, C4, CH50, and C3a desArg. Using samples from patients enrolled in the SELENA study, we will perform subgroup analyses in diverse ethnic groups, patients treated with exogenous estrogen, and patients with chronically depressed CH50.

In the second-an interventional study-we will evaluate the effectiveness of short-term corticosteroid treatment in averting flares when elevations of plasma C3a are accompanied by rising anti-dsDNA antibody. We will determine whether corticosteroid treatment reduces the frequency of clinical flare, serological abnormalities, or disease activity in inactive or stable patients. We will explore whether steroids disproportionately exacerbate or initiate comorbid medical conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) that may be more prevalent among minority patients. The studies should result in observations that lead to rational, cost-effective, and evidence-based guidelines that improve the treatment of patients with SLE and-by decreasing the morbidity of disease-result in significant improvement of their quality of life.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria:

We will look at how patients respond to a rehabilitation program that includes physical therapy and information about fibromyalgia. We will combine this program with psychological treatments that are either matched or mismatched to the way patients cope with and adapt to symptoms of FMS. The second aim of our study is to better understand how different FMS symptoms may vary together and how these symptoms change as a result of treatment in a person's natural environment. People with FMS and healthy people of the same ages will record their moods, thoughts, symptoms, activities, and fatigue levels three times a day for 2 weeks. Participants will use palm-top computers to record these ""real-time"" assessments. This approach will permit people to rate how they feel at a particular time rather than looking back in time.","Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a prevalent, chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder. Despite extensive study, researchers do not understand well the etiology and pathophysiologic mechanisms of FMS, and have not shown any treatment to be universally effective. We propose that FMS is a complex disorder involving multiple factors, both physical and psychosocial-behavioral.

In our previous research, we demonstrated that FMS patients are heterogeneous in the psychosocial-behavioral axis and can be classified into three distinct subgroups on the basis of their psychosocial adaptation to symptoms. In this study we will extend our previous research and attempt to match treatments to patients' psychosocial-behavioral characteristics. Specifically, we will test the efficacy of uniquely tailored treatment for each psychosocial subgroup.

We will treat three groups of FMS patients with one of three treatment protocols involving standard physical therapy and varying psychological treatments. A total of 312 FMS patients will undergo six half-day interdisciplinary treatment sessions consisting of psychological treatments and physical therapy emphasizing aerobic conditioning, pacing, and body mechanics. All protocols include a standardized physical therapy and either cognitive-behavioral pain management therapy, interpersonal skill training, or supportive counseling.

In addition to the treatment outcome study, we will prospectively assess various symptoms of FMS in the patients' natural habitats to better understand covariations of FMS symptoms. Patients will do repeated daily monitoring using a palm-top computer (ecological momentary assessment), which will permit us to evaluate process ratings compared to retrospective reports.

In tidal lavage, the doctor flushes out a knee joint with repeated injections of a mild salt solution, done under local anesthesia. Study participants had to meet standard criteria for diagnosis of osteoarthritis but could have low, medium, or high severity of x-ray changes indicating knee osteoarthritis. We performed the lavage procedure once, and did quarterly followups for 1 year. We permitted patients to use some other osteoarthritis treatments during the study, such as non-narcotic pain relievers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy.","This study was a randomized, double-blind, sham procedure-controlled evaluation of tidal lavage as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. We achieved blinding by raising a drape during the study procedure and mimicking the sensory aspects of tidal lavage, but not flushing the knee, in the sham lavage group. We gave all study participants subcutaneous anesthesia with lidocaine and then bupivacaine and then attempted aspiration of the knee, removing up to 5 ml of synovial fluid for examination and then injecting the knee with 20 ml of bupivicaine.

In people who received the sham treatment, we placed a 16-gauge catheter in the lateral suprapatellar position just to the knee joint capsule and infused small volumes (less than 5 ml per ""exchange"" x 20) of saline into the subcutaneous tissue while manipulating the anterior knee to mimic efforts to shift fluid within the knee during the ""aspiration"" phase of each exchange. Patients could see the supply bag of sterile saline but could not see the waste bag of this closed drainage system.

For tidal lavage patients, we made the catheter puncture in the lateral suprapatellar pouch and repeatedly distended the knee with 30-50 ml of sterile saline, then aspirated this volume (about 20 exchanges for a total of 1 liter of flush solution).

At the end of the procedure, we told the patients that their knee might be swollen due to retained saline, and to expect this additional swelling to resolve over 24-48 hours, during which time they were to minimize activity. The person who did the procedure (the principal investigator) then left the room. The study nurse, who was not present for the procedure and was blinded to the procedure's identity, asked the patients which treatment they thought they received (tidal lavage or sham lavage).

The two main results we will look at are disease progression according to x-rays and disability over 3.5 years. Study participants with moderate knee OA and knee pain will continue taking their NSAID or stop taking their NSAID and start taking acetaminophen. Every 6 months we will send the participants questionnaires that ask about pain, medication use, and disability. We will take x-rays of the knees at the start of the study and again at the end of the study.","Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most popular agents used to treat the joint pain and inflammation associated with OA. Although NSAIDs are useful for pain management, recent studies have not found NSAIDs to be better than acetaminophen for the treatment of painful knee OA. The relative lack of efficacy and possibility of accelerated disease progression, coupled with the known gastrointestinal risks of these medications, especially to the elderly, have led us to reevaluate NSAIDs as the first-line medical therapy for osteoarthritis. Our dominant NSAID-based approach to this disease may be resulting in unnecessary costs, unnecessary toxicity, and accelerated disability.

These data allow us to hypothesize that NSAIDs, by inhibiting pain and inflammation in osteoarthritic joints, may cause or encourage people with OA to overuse damaged joints, resulting in accelerated joint degeneration and joint replacements at an earlier time or, alternatively, that treatment with NSAIDs may accelerate joint damage by altering cartilage metabolism and inhibiting joint healing. We further hypothesize that anti-inflammatory therapy with NSAIDs results in toxicities that lead to increased comorbidity and higher medical care use compared to analgesic therapy for OA.

The specific aims of our study are to determine if (1) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy accelerates joint degeneration compared to analgesic medications; and (2) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy results in greater comorbidity and higher medical care costs and use compared to simple analgesic medication. To accomplish these aims, we will randomize 200 people with knee OA and 200 people with hip OA, defined by a Kellgren and Lawrence x-ray grade of 2 or 3, currently on NSAIDs, to either NSAIDs at their current dose or acetaminophen up to 4000 mg/day for 4 years.

Primary outcome measures will be the rate of radiographic progression, and pain and disability in the two groups. Secondary outcome variables will include medical care use, time to joint replacements, and medication side-effect profiles. We will separately identify and describe those clinical, demographic, and radiographic variables that predict accelerated progression in each group by multivariate analyses.

We will perform fasting random urine tests to determine Ca/creatinine ratio to assess for treatment-induced hypercalciuria at months 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24.

Monthly during the intervention trial, the study coordinator will contact all participants by phone in a blinded fashion to increase compliance and encourage continued participation in the trial. We will evaluate participants 6 and 18 moths after the end of the intervention trial. At each of these visits, we will obtain the following: general and medication history, general and joint physical exam, Tanner Stage, anthropometric measurements, blood for minerals and calcitropic hormones, 24-hour urine collection for measurements of bone turnover markers and mineral excretion, JAFAR, physical activity questionnaire, and total body and lumbar spine DXA scans. The YAQ and 3-day diet diary will be completed at the 42-month visit. Prior to every DXA scan, we will do a urine pregnancy test in all menstruating females to ensure that they are not pregnant. Any patient who withdraws from the blinded portion of the study early will complete an evaluation as outlined for the 24 months visit. Patients who withdraw early during the open phase of the study will complete the 42 months evaluation.

We will exclude from the study people who have recently taken systemic corticosteroids, people taking oral contraceptives, smokers, and pregnant women because these factors have been shown to significantly lower bone mineralization. We will withdraw subjects from the study if they demonstrate an elevated fasting random urinary calcium/creatinine ratio (>0.2), a chronic disease in addition to JRA that affects growth or bone mineralization, or they become pregnant. We will include these patients and all those withdrawing from the study voluntarily in an ""intention-to-treat"" analysis.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria:

430498,NCT00000430,N01 AR92237,National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS),NIH,Low-Dose Hormone Replacement Therapy and Alendronate for Osteoporosis,February 2004,Terminated,National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS),NIH,"Osteoporosis, a condition in which bones are fragile and break easily, is a major health problem for postmenopausal women. Research studies have shown that both estrogen/progestin replacement therapy (hormone replacement therapy, or HRT) and alendronate are effective in preventing and treating osteoporosis. However, because these drugs work in somewhat different ways, a combination of the two drugs might protect women from osteoporosis better than either drug alone. In this study we will test whether HRT and alendronate given together for 3.5 years to postmenopausal women with low bone mass will have a greater effect on bone than either HRT or alendronate given alone. We will also give every participant in this study calcium and vitamin D supplements.","Clinical trials of estrogen/progestin replacement therapy (HRT) and a bisphosphonate, alendronate (ALN), have demonstrated that both are effective in causing gains in bone mass and preventing bone loss and fractures in postmenopausal women. The FDA has approved both these drugs for prevention and treatment of fractures, and both are widely used in clinical practice. Because both are approved and effective, and they work by different mechanisms, many patients and their physicians ask whether both should be taken in combination, particularly in cases of severe disease. The question is asked frequently because of the high incidence of osteoporosis among women and the need for long-term prevention and treatments that often last decades.

Indeed, physicians are using ALN and HRT together without adequate scientific support for the assumption that the combination is more effective than either given alone.

Clinical trials are now underway to test conventional doses of HRT given as conjugated equine estrogens (CEE), 0.625 mg/day or its equivalent, combined with ALN, 10 mg/day. However, researchers are not studying the bone-sparing effectiveness of the combined administration of ALN and low-dose continuous HRT given as CEE, 0.3 mg/d, along with medroxyprogesterone, 2.5 mg/d (MP). This low-dose continuous HRT regimen is attractive because of better convenience, better patient tolerance, and reduced risk of breast cancer and other safety concerns associated with conventional higher doses. Further, we have recently demonstrated that the bone-sparing effect of this regimen is comparable to that of higher doses.

The long-term objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the combined therapy shows a greater bone effect than does either treatment given alone. Our specific aim is to conduct a 3.5 year, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of low-dose, continuous HRT combined with alendronate, 10 mg/d (ALN), in three groups (72 people per group) of estrogen-deprived postmenopausal women over age 60. We will give Group 1 low-dose HRT, Group 2 ALN, and Group 3 both low-dose HRT and ALN. We will give calcium and vitamin D supplements to people in all three groups.

The primary outcome measures will be spine bone mineral density (SpBMD) and total hip bone mineral density (HipBMD) measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Secondary outcome measures will be total body bone mineral content and forearm bone mineral content. In addition, we will perform studies to characterize the mechanism of the effects of these regimens. These studies will consist of measurements of urinary bone resorption markers, serum bone formation markers, calcium excretion, calcium absorption, and application of a model developed in our laboratory to estimate and compare the magnitudes of the anabolic effects (if any) of all three interventions on SpBMD and HipBMD.

We have reported data showing that both agents have an anabolic effect on bone in humans, meaning that they cause an increase in bone mass beyond that explained by a remodeling transient brought about by reduction in bone remodeling rates. Further, research has shown that HRT and ALN affect bone by different mechanisms. Thus, this combination may have an additive effect on bone resulting in bone gain beyond that previously seen with other interventions. This project will provide much-needed information to physicians and their patients on the benefits and safety of this combination regimen so that they can make ""evidence-based"" decisions on the choice of interventions to prevent and treat osteoporosis.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria:

Although researchers have made great progress in understanding how the body repairs wounds, attempts to develop new treatments have been disappointing. In general, treatments based on recent findings about the details of wound repair have not greatly reduced the number of people who have chronic wounds. The long-term goal of this study is to evaluate a new approach for healing a chronic wound. Current methods of directly applying substances that are involved in wound healing to a chronic wound do not cause enough healing. PDGF-B (platelet-derived growth factor B), a factor associated with wound healing, might dramatically enhance healing if a genetically engineered virus is injected into the wound that causes cells in the wound to produce PDGF-B in large quantities.","Most chronic wounds of the leg fail to heal in a reasonable period of time. In fact, despite considerable advances in elucidating the molecular basis of wound repair, attempts to develop new therapies have been disappointing. In general, therapies based on recently elucidated mechanisms of wound repair have had minimal effect on the overall number of individuals with a treated healed chronic wound. The long-term goal of this study is to evaluate a new approach for healing a chronic wound. Current methods of applying cytokines as a topical protein to treat chronic wounds result in an inadequate response. PDGF-B, a growth factor associated with wound healing, might dramatically enhance wound healing when produced in large quantities in the wound bed via adenovirus-mediated gene overexpression by the cells of the wound bed.

This study consists of two trials. The goal of Trial A, a dose-escalation trial, is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PDGF-B/Ad5, an adenovirus vector designed to overexpress PDGF-B, with respect to local and systemic toxicity and biologic feasibility. The primary objective is to evaluate the acute safety, both local and systemic, of an intra-ulcer injection of PDGF-B/Ad5, thereby determining the recommended dose. Upon evaluating patients, they will be treated with a single intra-ulcer injection of PDGF-B/Ad5 in the wound. Patients will receive only one dose, which will be administered during a 72-hour inpatient stay in a research unit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.

This study will use a standard three-six dose-escalation scheme. The MTD is defined as the highest dose for which fewer than two of six subjects experience a severe adverse reaction. Each patient will be closely monitored for clinical adverse reactions resulting from treatment with PDGF-B/Ad5. Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria Scale.

The primary objective of Trial B is to evaluate the safety and biologic feasibility of the MTD of PDGF-B/Ad5 reported in Trial A in a standard 24-week trial for treatment of a venous leg ulcer. For this study, 15 consecutive patients will be treated using the MTD. All patients will receive a single intra-ulcer injection of PDGF-B/Ad5 and a limb compression bandage to be changed weekly.Study participants will be followed for 24 weeks, which is the length of most FDA-approved venous leg ulcer trials.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria:

Some boats provide passengers with the experimental program and the other boats provide a ""control"" program that the researchers can compare to the experimental program. The experimental program uses live performances by entertainers to teach people about Lyme disease prevention, and also uses additional printed materials. People on the control boats receive education on injury prevention and road safety while bicycling, rollerblading, and using mopeds. The main result we will look for is Lyme disease identified by a followup survey and confirmed by reviewing medical records. We will also ask some people to take part in a smaller study of behavior change. In this study, we will ask people to complete forms on self-efficacy (a person's belief in his or her ability to reach a certain goal), their plans to take preventive steps, and actual prevention behaviors. We also ask participants who report doctor visits or illness to provide confirmation of their use of health services.","This is a large, randomized trial of a Lyme disease primary prevention program for passengers on ferry boats going to Nantucket Island for the period from Memorial Day until Labor Day. Boats are randomized to experimental or control interventions.

The experimental intervention is a performance-based educational program on Lyme disease prevention, and uses supplemental materials. An entertainment troupe delivers the intervention using comedy, theater, and vaudevillian techniques. The entertainers present three shows in different locations on the boat. Each show is about 10 minutes and covers the severity and likelihood of acquiring Lyme disease and the benefits of tick avoidance and search and removal behaviors. When people on experimental boats enroll in the study they receive the following free materials: a wallet-sized tick ID card, a laminated shower card with tick-removal instructions, a map showing tick habitats, a tick-feeling card, and an educational pamphlet. Control boats do not have performers. Participants on control boats receive education on road safety and injury prevention from rollerblade, bicycle, and skateboard accidents.

We will collect baseline data at enrollment, including name, address, demographics, resident/visitor status, length of stay on island, frequency of exposure to tick areas, history of tick-transmitted disease, and exposure to intervention. We will enroll a random subsample of participants in a study of behavior, and will ask them additional questions on self-efficacy, intention to perform prevention behaviors and attitude about or social support for practicing prevention behaviors while on the island.

We will follow people in the behavioral subsample at 1 week to find out their actual behaviors. We will follow all subjects at 2 months to find out self-reported disease status.

The drug, called Enbrel (or etanercept), is a protein that is given twice weekly by injection underneath the skin. It blocks the action of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a substance that may be involved in AS, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions. We will randomly assign patients to receive either the drug or a placebo (inactive treatment) for 4 months. The results we will monitor include morning stiffness, spinal mobility, activities of daily life, and safety of the drug.","In this Phase II clinical trial we will use tumor necrosis factor receptor p75 fusion protein (TNFR:Fc, or etanercept) to treat patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). TNFR:Fc is an antagonist of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a cytokine that researchers have shown to play a possible role in disease pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and vasculitis, as well as other inflammatory conditions.

TNFR:Fc consists of two molecules of the extracellular portion of the p75 receptor, each consisting of 235 amino acids. The two receptors are fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1, which consists of 232 amino acids. The gene fragments encoding the truncated TNFR and the Fc portion of human IgG1 are expressed in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line.

Recent observations from animal and human studies suggest that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) may play a role in disease activity in AS and other seronegative spondyloarthropathies. This study aims to test the efficacy of TNFR:Fc used in conjunction with standard medications in the treatment of AS.

However, these studies have not looked at the impact of exercise programs for older adults with osteoarthritis or at how long older adults continue exercising after a program is finished. This study will look at the long-term effects of a structured exercise program for people aged 60 or older who have osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. One goal of the exercise program is to encourage older people with osteoarthritis to continue exercising.

We will randomly assign study participants to either the exercise program or a control group that does not do the exercise program. We will monitor participants at the start of the study, at 8 weeks, and every 3 months for 2 years after the program is completed. The exercise program lasts for 8 weeks and includes an exercise part and an educational part led by trained physical therapists. We believe that participants in the treatment (exercise) group will show higher rates of continued exercise and higher functional status over time compared to the group of people who do not participate in the exercise program.","Recent exercise interventions have demonstrated statistically significant short-term improvements in muscle strength, fitness, and physical activity in people under the age of 70.

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups. One group (control group) will receive standard medical care. The other group will participate in a program of patient education and strength training, including an at-home walking program.","The specific aims of this project are to (a) implement an intervention program of patient education focused on self-efficacy (the belief that one's actions are responsible for successful outcomes) and strength training designed to improve the postoperative rehabilitation of older persons (65 years of age and older) who have sustained a fracture of the hip; and (b) evaluate in a randomized trial the efficacy of this intervention program to improve the overall postoperative functional status of such patients and decrease the rate of their subsequent institutionalization.

The study will also (a) describe and document the risk factors for functional deterioration, recurrent falls, and subsequent institutionalization in a cohort of such patients; (b) assess self-efficacy beliefs and their ability to influence and predict postoperative functional capacity in such patients; and (c) document the costs associated with implementing the program and generate data that can provide the basis for subsequent cost-benefit analysis.

We hypothesize that (a) a program of patient education focusing on self-efficacy and strength training can improve the functional capacity and reduce the rate of institutionalization of older persons following hip fracture; and (b) clinical, psychosocial factors, muscle strength, and balance are multifactorial determinants of functional capacity, recurrent falls, and subsequent institutionalization in hip fracture patients.

We will randomize 200 patients who have sustained a primary unilateral hip fracture to the multiple-component intervention program of patient education and high-intensity strength training or to standard medical care. The intervention program will comprise four major components: (1) an in-hospital postoperative patient instruction protocol conducted prior to discharge with the patient and a family member or caregiver; (2) a hospital-based, 8-week program of high-intensity isokinetic strength training for patients; (3) an at-home walking program designed to enable patients to maintain strength and physical activity following the hospital-based portion of the intervention; and (4) supportive telephone calls through which patients and their families or caregivers will have regular and ongoing contact with a hospital-based interventionist, as well as other hip fracture patients.

Several lines of evidence provided the rationale for intervening in children. A large body of autopsy and pathologic evidence had accumulated showing that atherosclerosis, including fatty streaks, increased surface involvement, and advanced microscopic lesions, began in childhood. Blood cholesterol levels tracked from childhood to adulthood, with tracking correlations ranging from .6 to .8. Therefore, a high proportion of children with high levels of cholesterol have high levels as adults. Family clustering of risk factors had also been reported. Studies showed 2-3 times increased prevalence of coronary heart disease in adult relatives of children with high cholesterol compared to children with normal cholesterol, and 2.2 times increased prevalence in high cholesterol in children who had a parent or grandparent with premature coronary heart disease compared with children who did not have a family history of premature heart disease. Finally, there was high likelihood that environmental influences on coronary heart disease risk factors had their behavioral antecents in childhood. Thus, dietary habits which contributed toward elevated blood cholesterol levels were likely to have developed early in life, and it was hoped that behavioral change achieved during childhood was likely to persist into adulthood.

Although numerous studies had shown that dietary modification could lower blood cholesterol levels in adults, only a few studies had shown this effect in children, and none were long-term. Furthermore, the impact on long-term growth and development in children had not been studied. Concerns were raised about the safety of cholesterol-lowering diets in children, particularly during peak growing years. These concerns included possible deficits in growth and nutrient adequacy, and potential adverse psychological effects. This paucity of data was a potential barrier to active prevention measures. To fill this gap in knowledge, the DISC trial, a randomized, controlled clinical trial, tested the efficacy and safety of long-term dietary intervention for reduction of serum LDL-C levels in children during puberty.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

In the feasibility study, children of both sexes, ages 8 to 10 at baseline starting in 1987, were randomized to either a control group or to a usual care group for whom more intensive dietary intervention for the child and the family was directed. The feasibility study lasted 16 months. The full-scale trial began in December 1988 with the randomization of a total of 663 children. At baseline, mean LDL-C levels, nutrient intakes, anthropometric measurements, nutritional biochemical levels, and psychosocial measures were similar in the two groups. The intervention group was assigned to a series of group and individual sessions to teach the children and their families to follow a diet containing 28 percent of calories as total fat, dietary cholesterol intake less than 75 mg/1000 kcal, and up to 9% of calories from polyunsaturated fat. The diets were designed to meet nutritional requirements of growing children. The usual care group was provided a packet of general dietary information only. The primary efficacy outcome was a difference in changes in LDL-C levels between the two groups at 36 months. Primary safety endpoints were change in height and serum ferritin levels. Secondary safety outcomes included serum zinc, retinol, albumin levels, red blood cell folate, ratio of LDL-C to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, sexual maturation, cognitive development, and psychosocial assessments. Recruitment was completed in July 1990. Intervention and follow-up was extended until 1997 when the participants were on average 17 years old. Data analysis continued through January 1999.

A vast amount of literature exists on the improvements in work capacity, reduction of risk factors, and an increased feeling of well-being among coronary heart disease patients after physical training programs. Previous observations of short-term training programs which resulted in an increase in physical working capacity have not usually shown a cardiac change. The National Exercise and Heart Disease Project did not show such changes, but the exercise level may have been inadequate. Several other studies suggested that more prolonged and intense training could result in improved cardiac function.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Patients were randomized to high intensity or low intensity long-term exercise groups. Compliance was strengthened by randomizing following a sequence of eligibility visits and after a test period of subject reaction to an exercise program. The primary endpoint was change in exercise ejection fraction at one year. Secondary endpoints included changes in lipid levels, body composition, blood pressure and heart rate measurements, glucose tolerance, quality of life measures, compliance, and progression of disease. Patients were classified into one of four strata based on the documented history of myocardial infarction and resting left ventricular ejection fraction. Within each stratum, patients were assigned in equal numbers to the two intensity levels of exercise intervention. All exercise prescriptions were based on exercise testing of patients maintained on their usual medical regimen including drugs. Patients underwent standardized multistage treadmill exercise testing monitored by Doppler echocardiogram at baseline, just prior to randomization and at the three month, six month, one year and two year visits. Patients participated in the structured group exercise sessions three days per week. Each exercise session was preceded by and ended with a five to fifteen minute warm-up and cool-down session. Each patient was given an exercise prescription that included a 30 minute period of walking or of walking and jogging sequences and 15 minutes of arm-leg bicycle ergometer exercise.

Finally, to determine the effect of combination therapy with lipid-reducing drugs in patients with coronary heart disease and ""normal"" cholesterol levels. At least three clinical trials were conducted.","BACKGROUND:

The prognosis of patients with coronary heart disease is closely related to the degree of coronary luminal obstruction. In population studies, the incidence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis on angiography is correlated with diet and plasma lipoprotein cholesterol. Previous clinical trials had shown that treatments that lowered plasma concentrations of low density lipoprotein cholesterol benefited some hypercholesterolemic patients with coronary heart disease. No similar benefit had been demonstrated in normocholesterolemic patients who make up the majority of patients with coronary heart disease.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

In the cholesterol-lowering agent trial, all patients received Step 1 dietary instruction before randomization and every three months thereafter. Randomization was stratified by medical or surgical treatment for coronary disease and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol. A total of 39 patients were assigned to placebo and 40 to active treatment with pravastatin, nicotinic acid, cholestyramine, and gemfibrozil stepwise as needed to reach the specified goal (total cholesterol less than or equal to 4.1 mmol/L, ratio of LDL/HDL cholesterol less than or equal to 2.0). Lipid concentrations were measured every six weeks. Baseline angiograms were compared to angiograms taken at 30 months.

In the fish oil trial, 41 patients were randomized to fish oil capsules containing 6 grams of n-3 fatty acids daily and 39 patients were randomized to olive oil placebo capsules for an average duration of 28 months. Each fish oil capsule contained 500 mg of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids composed of 240 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid, 160 mg of docosahexaenoic acid, and 100 mg of mainly docosapentaenoic acid. Randomization was stratified by medical or surgical treatment for coronary disease and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol. The primary outcome variable was change in minimal diameter of coronary artery lesions expressed as a continuous variable. During the initial hospital stay for catheterization, dietary instruction was provided to every patient according to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step 1 guidelines. A seven-day diet record was collected at the randomization visit and every three months during the trial. Every twelve weeks, a research nurse reviewed with the patients side effects, diet, and concomitant medications and performed a pill count. Every 24 weeks, the patients received an interval medical history and physical examination by a physician. A fasting blood sample was obtained for lipid analysis at the 12- and 24-week visits and every 24 weeks thereafter. If the total cholesterol level of any patient increased to 250 mg/dl (6.43 mmol/liter) or greater on two consecutive measurements, intensified dietary instruction was given, followed by drug therapy with cholestyramine or nicotinic acid or both as needed to lower total cholesterol to less than 250 mg/dl. Twenty-one patients did not complete the protocol due to death, refusal to undergo the second cardiac catheterization, development of medical conditions precluding participation, intolerance to the capsules, and a missing initial angiogram.

In the combination therapy trial, patients were randomized to usual care or to stepped-care drug therapy with lipid-lowering agents including pravastatin, nicotinic acid, cholestyramine, and gemfibrozil to decrease total cholesterol levels to less than 160 mg/dl and the ratio of low density lipoprotein cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol to less than 2.0. Measurements included fasting serum lipoprotein profile, fasting apolipoprotein levels, and frequency of adverse effects. Patients were assessed every six weeks during drug titration and every three months thereafter for two -and-a-half years.

The management of patients with symptomatic coronary heart disease has evolved considerably in the past twenty years with the application of invasive techniques in an ever increasing proportion of patients.

With refinements in CABG surgery over the past twenty years, operative myocardial revascularization is feasible in most patients with myocardial ischemia. Several multicenter, randomized trials have been reported, comparing medical with surgical management in patients with coronary artery disease. Based on the three largest trials and an extensive observational literature, a consensus appears to be emerging regarding the circumstances under which medical or surgical management appears to be the method of choice.

It is clear that CABG relieves angina in the vast majority of patients with severe symptoms. It is also apparent that this procedure can be performed with very low risk by experienced operative teams. Thus, CABG is indicated for patients with suitable coronary anatomy who have severe angina refractory to medical therapy and those with significant obstruction of left main coronary artery.

The timing of operative intervention in patients with less severe angina is a point of some dispute at present. It is, however, apparent that certain categories of patients have improved survival after elective bypass surgery. These categories include patients with left main coronary stenosis, triple vessel disease with modestly impaired ventricular function, and possibly other clinically defined high risk patients. The remaining patients with mild, symptomatic coronary disease, it would appear, can afford to defer operative intervention until such time as symptoms worsen and require palliation.

Long-term information is available on some patients who had CABG in the early 1970s. By ten years substantial progression of disease is present in both the native coronary circulation and in the bypass grafts. Investigators have reported that as many as two-thirds of vein bypass grafts are closed or narrowed and intrinsic coronary disease has progressed in as many as one-half of non-bypassed vessels at 10 years following surgery. The timing of surgery in less severely symptomatic patients, strategies to decrease disease progression in grafted vessels and native circulation, and renewed interest in the use of the internal mammary artery to revascularize the heart are very active research issues at present.

PTCA was first applied to human coronary disease in 1977. There have been major advances in catheter design, balloon construction, and identification of both high and low risk patients for this procedure. Experienced angioplasty teams can now successfully dilate severe lesions in more than 90 percent of patients attempted. This success rate can be achieved with less than one percent operative mortality and less than five percent myocardial infarction and/or emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. However, as many as one-third of successfully dilated patients will experience the return of angina within the following six months to one year, reflecting restenosis of the dilated lesion. Most of these individuals can successfully undergo a second dilatation.

Thus, two quite effective interventions are available for patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease sufficient to require palliation by some mechanical means. Each has strengths and weaknesses. PTCA is relatively noninvasive, requires initially fewer hospital days and less intensive care, and preserves veins and mediastinum for CABG should it be required later. However, not all lesions present in a patient with multivessel disease can be dilated. There is substantial risk of restenosis and recurrence of symptoms, and a small but finite risk of having to undergo immediate CABG surgery following a failed PTCA, considerably increasing the risk of the surgery. CABG surgery results in more complete revascularization and relatively low short-term graft closure, and it can be done with an acute risk approximately equal to PTCA. However, it is apparent that surgical intervention does not change a patient's propensity to atherosclerosis; in ten years two-thirds of grafts have been compromised with atherosclerosis or thrombosis and there has been progression of atherosclerosis in the native, non-bypassed coronary circulation in roughly one-half of the patients. Second operations are considerably more difficult technically, carry a higher operative risk, and result in less dramatic relief of symptoms. There is a substantial population of patients with severe, symptomatic, multivessel coronary disease in whom it is unclear whether PTCA or CABG should be applied first.

In September 1984, the Workshop on Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery recommended consideration of a clinical trial involving surgery and angioplasty. An NHLBI Task Force, established in January 1985, recommended that a clinical trial in multivessel coronary artery disease be considered by the Institute. The Cardiology Advisory Committee unanimously recommended the design and execution of a trial. In September 1985, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council discussed this clinical trial initiative and recommended it enthusiastically.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Patients who received coronary arteriography at the clinical units because of severe angina or unstable angina, with or without antecedent myocardial infarction, were asked to participate in the study. A total of 2,013 eligible patients who refused randomization and 422 who were ineligible on the basis of angiographic findings were asked to participate in the follow-up registry. The remaining patients were then randomized, 914 to CABG and 915 to PTCA, between August 1988 and August 1991. Baseline data included the clinical profile, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and information on coronary angiographic features, angina and functional status, medications, risk factors, and quality of life. Initial revascularization was performed within two weeks after randomization. Angiograms (baseline and sub study directed at 1 year and 5 years), and ECG's are interpreted by respective core laboratories. Scheduled multiple stages of PTCA were counted as a single procedure. New interventional devices, such as stents, were not used during the initial revascularization. Follow-up visits were conducted at the clinics at weeks four through fourteen after study entry and at one, three, and five years, with telephone contacts at six months and two and four years. The importance of risk factor modification was emphasized throughout the study to the patients and their primary physicians. The primary end point was mortality from all causes.

The trial has been extended through November 2002 to complete the minimum ten-year followup on all BARI patients, determine the relative efficacy of PTCA versus CABG in subgroups of women, Blacks, diabetics, and elderly, and assess the public health impact of BARI. In the followup, all currently enrolled patients will have annual telephone interviews. At ten years, the electrocardiogram will be obtained on all patients and blood lipid levels will be performed on randomized patients only. All hospitalizations that occurred since the last contact will be identified on the annual telephone contact. Angina will be assessed for the preceding six weeks. At each patient contact, patients will be instructed in behavior modification in the areas of smoking cessation, exercise, and diet. Angiographic studies will also be conducted as part of the ten-year follow-up. The four centers which participated in the first phase of these BARI activities will again conduct the angiograms. Patients will consist of the established cohort drawn from the randomized participants who completed one and five year angiograms.

A substudy of BARI, Study of Economics and Quality of Life (SEQOL), was initially funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to assess the impact of a specific revascularization on quality of life, functional and economic (hospital and physician charges) outcomes in patients randomized to BARI, and to examine factors other than treatments that affect these outcomes. Beginning in July 1997, support for SEQOL was assumed by the NHLBI under grant R01HL58324. The grant, ending in June 2002, extends the follow-up of the randomized SEQOL substudy cohort (752 subjects surviving as of May 1, 1996) to ten years to study the long-term determinants of cost and quality of life and to develop a model to project the impact of technologic changes on outcomes and cost of CABG and PTCA.

A large number of studies have reported that following CABG, the vessels proximal to the grafts demonstrate accelerated atherosclerosis and the grafts themselves may show progressive obstruction due to thrombosis, fibrosis, and graft atheroma. Pathological and clinical studies have documented that graft obstruction during the perioperative period and the first year is usually due to technical problems at surgery or thrombosis and occurs in about 15 to 20 percent of saphenous vein grafts. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin have been shown to reduce these early graft occlusions by about 50 percent. In addition to thrombosis, during the first year, most saphenous vein grafts undergo diffuse fibrosis and some distortion. However, the significance of these changes is not known.

After the first year, lipid deposition and changes histologically similar to atherosclerosis have been documented both in experimental studies and in human saphenous vein grafts patent at one year completely occlude and an additional 30 percent narrow over a period of ten years. These angiographic changes in the saphenous vein grafts correlate with high LDL-cholesterol, low HDL-cholesterol and high apolipoprotein B levels. In experimental animals, cholesterol deposition in the grafts has been substantially increased or decreased by increasing or decreasing the saturated fats and cholesterol in the animal's diets. In contrast to changes in the saphenous vein grafts, internal mammary artery grafts have shown substantially lower rates of obstruction. The native vessels (both ungrafted vessels and grafted vessels at distal or proximal sites), however, show evidence of progressive atherosclerosis. The long-term follow-up of grafts also demonstrates thrombotic material and even occlusive thrombus as part of acute events.

Progression of atherosclerotic lesions in grafts and native vessels lead to recurrent angina, unaltered long-term survival and reduced efficacy of repeat CABG surgery. Johnson in an 11 year follow-up of 3,105 post-CABG patients, reported that about 15 percent of patients with preoperative angina have recurrent angina at 1 year; with a further 6 percent developing angina every subsequent year. In this study, patients with recurrent angina had twice the mortality compared to those who were angina-free. Long-term follow-up of the VA Cooperative Trial of CABG shows that the survival of the surgical group appears to be initially superior compared to the medical group but this benefit is diminished by about ten years. This may relate to graft obstruction and progression of native coronary atherosclerosis. Re-operation in these patients carries a higher operative mortality risk and the results are less impressive. It had been estimated that approximately 5 percent of all CABG surgery in 1984 were re-operations and that this percentage would double over the next decade. Therefore, measures to prevent graft occlusion and progression of atherosclerosis in native vessels, if successful, could have substantial clinical and economic importance by reducing mortality, morbidity and the numbers of patients undergoing re-operations.

Apart from trials of aspirin and dipyridamole in post-CABG patients that demonstrated a significant reduction in graft closure within the first year after surgery, there were no large systematic studies of interventions in these patients. Graft occlusion has been shown to correlate with high LDL-cholesterol and low HDL-cholesterol, and the severity of atherosclerosis has been additionally shown to be related to cigarette smoking and increased levels of coagulation factor. Therefore, lowering the LDL cholesterol (by diet and drugs), and anti-thrombotic therapy with warfarin were logical choices for intervention.

Several studies suggested that CABG surgery relieved angina and improved overall quality of life. However, in the available studies, CABG did not consistently appear to be associated with an improvement in employment status, physical recreational activity, or life style. The reasons for these results were not entirely clear and there was a need to identify the biobehavioral and psychosocial factors that predicted successful adjustment after CABG.

The initiative was proposed by Institute staff and approved by the September 1985 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The Request for Proposals was released in September 1985 and awards made in April 1987.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. All prospective participants received active warfarin treatment for a month prior to randomization. Only participants demonstrating a minimal reaction to warfarin and consuming over 90 percent of the prescribed medication were randomized. Dietary modification to lower serum cholesterol, an exercise program, and a smoking cessation program were implemented. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2 X 2 factorial design in four treatment groups: aggressive LDL-C lowering with lovastatin 40 to 80 mg/d and, as necessary cholestyramine 8 mg/d to achieve and LDL-C of 60 to 85 mg/dl; moderate LDL-C lowering with lovastatin 2.5 to 5 mg/d, with cholestyramin as needed, to achieve a LDL-C of 130 to 140 mg/dl; warfarin 1 to 4 mg/d to achieve an INR of 1.8 to 2.0; and warfarin-placebo. All participants were followed for five years, at the end of which selective coronary and graft angiography was performed. The primary angiography endpoint was the proportion of major SVG per patient that showed substantial reduction (0.06 mm or greater) in lumen diameter. Biobehavioral studies were conducted in 750 participants.

Planning for the study began in April 1987 and a final protocol was developed by August 1988. Patient recruitment has been completed. Follow-up ended on September 1, 1995 and data analysis continues through December 1998 under contract N01-HC-75076. .

Sudden cardiac death can usually be attributed to the occurrence of the cardiac arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation. Although a significant proportion of patients experiencing sudden cardiac death may be successfully resuscitated without disabling sequelae, this event tends to recur. Recurrent sudden cardiac death is more common among patients demonstrating certain clinical characteristics such as: ventricular fibrillation occurring in a setting of a remote prior transmural infarction; the presence of abnormal left ventricular function; male gender; concurrent complex ventricular arrhythmias identified by electrocardiographic monitoring; extensive coronary artery disease; and the ability to induce ventricular arrhythmias following electrical stimulation.

Multiple therapeutic approaches are offered to patients surviving primary ventricular fibrillation. In those with evidence of myocardial ischemia, coronary revascularization procedures may be employed. Pharmacological therapy with anti-arrhythmic agents either alone or in combination with selection guided by the results of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring or electrophysiologic studies is often the initial step. For those patients refractory to medical therapy, ventricular resection or implantation of pacemakers has been employed.

Amiodarone, a unique antiarrhythmic agent with complex pharmacokinetics and substantial potential toxicity, has been utilized when other antiarrhythmic agents failed. The agent was released as an oral agent for the treatment of ventricular fibrillation in the United States by the FDA. Several investigations suggested that amiodarone was efficacious in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation when other available agents had failed.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Patients were stratified by presence or absence of coronary artery disease, left ventricular function, and presence or absence of drug failure prior to randomization. All patients underwent an evaluation of left ventricular ejection fraction, usually by radionuclide ventriculography, and baseline drug-free Holter recording or electrophysiologic study, or both. A total of 113 patients were randomized to amiodarone and 115 patients to conventional therapy with other antiarrhythmic agents which included procainamide, quinidine, disopyramide, tocainide, mexiletine, encainide, flecainide, propafenone, moricizine, or combination therapy in that order. Holter exams were given at one, three, six, twelve, twenty-four, and thirty-six months. Patients were followed for one to five years, with an average of three years overall. Primary endpoints for the study included in the term 'cardiac survival' were cardiac mortality, resuscitated cardiac arrest due to documented ventricular fibrillation, and complete syncope followed by a shock from an automated implanted defibrillator. These endpoints included sudden arrhythmic cardiac death, resuscitated out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation, and nonarrhythmic cardiac death. A patient death due to amiodarone pulmonary toxicity was also considered a primary endpoint.",Interventional,Men and women with ventricular fibrillation who had survived an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest not associated with a Q-wave acute myocardial infarction.,No,All,18 Years,75 Years,

PTCA is widely practiced as the procedure of choice for revascularization of the myocardium in patients with single-vessel disease who are deemed to need intervention and is probably more widely applied than surgery would be in the same group of patients. No study has shown improved survival by intervention in such patients. The early natural history study by Oberman showed survival experience of patients with single-vessel disease, including the anterior descending, to resemble more closely patients with no coronary artery disease than those with multivessel disease. Quality of life studies including the CASS randomized study, which included 27 percent single-vessel disease patients, showed improved exercise tolerance and less need for medication in patients who received PTCA For single-vessel disease. Balloon angioplasty in single-vessel disease thus appears justified for the treatment of angina pectoris.

In multivessel disease the CASS randomized trial has shown an improved survival at seven years in the subset of patients with three-vessel disease and impaired ventricular function. However, seven years may prove to be the point of widest separation between the medical and surgical survival curves, based on the experience of the VA study which has presented results to 11 years showing convergence of survival experience. Data from the Montreal Heart Institute also indicate accelerated deterioration of venous grafts five to seven years after surgery. The late failure of grafts is a potent argument for delaying CABG as long as possible in the patients with multivessel disease. Should PTCA prove to be only a delaying action in multivessel disease patients, a delay of several years until the first CABG operation would confer an obvious advantage, even if repeat PTCA's were required. Repeat CABG may carry an increased risk and presumably the possibility of inadequate revascularization as autologous graft material is used up.

As long as treatment for coronary artery disease is only palliative, management for the individual patient requires a long-term (a lifetime) strategy, beginning with medical management. PTCA could occupy an intermediate position in the time line of management of multivessel disease patients if its relative efficiency in providing relief of ischemia and ability to avoid or delay CABG were known. Most centers performing PTCA now have expanded the indications for the procedure to patients with multivessel disease. However, its efficacy in those patients has not been proven. Although data from the NHLBI PTCA Registry do include patients with multivessel disease, most of those patients underwent only single PTCA procedures even though they may have had stenoses in other vessels. Hence, a number of questions must be raised concerning the usefulness of PTCA in patients with multivessel disease.

Randomized, single-center. A total of 198 patients were randomized to the PTCA group and 194 to the CABG group. As initial treatment, one patient in the CABG group underwent angioplasty and two patients in the PTCA group underwent surgery, but the groups were followed according to an intention-to-treat analysis. Randomization was performed on the basis of four angiographic strata. Data were collected at baseline, and the patients were contacted every six months for follow-up information. Coronary arteriography and thallium stress scanning were performed at one and three years. All patients were followed for the duration of the trial. Repeat angiographic studies were performed in 87 percent of the eligible patients at one year and in 76 percent at three years. Thallium scans were obtained in 88 percent of the patients at one year and in 77 percent at three years. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, Q-wave myocardial infarction within the previous three years, and detection of a large ischemic defect on thallium scanning at three years. Secondary endpoints involved the degree of revascularization at one and three years, ventricular function, exercise performance, the need for subsequent revascularization procedures, the quality of life, and costs. All patients admitted to Emory University Hospital and Crawford Long Memorial Hospital for cardiac catheterization, whether entered into the study or not, were entered into a study registry as were patients who were referred for a revascularization procedure but who had their initial catheterization performed elsewhere. Recruitment ended in April 1990. The trial has been extended through August 1997 to allow a minimum of eight years and a maximum of ten years of followup for the registry patients as well as for the main cohort of randomized patients. Telephone contact is established annually with study participants in order to determine rates of survival, rehospitalization, repeat revascularization procedures, and functional status. The justification for the long-term followup is the evidence that CABG begins to increase its failure rates between five and ten years.

The extended follow-up is for 3 years focusing on endometrium and breast evaluation.","BACKGROUND:

The life expectancy of American women is 78 years. More than one-third of those years are postmenopausal, during which time the risk of coronary heart disease is increased. The current United States estimate of more than 40 million women over the age of 50 indicates a large segment of the population at increased risk for coronary heart disease. Heart disease accounts for a third of all deaths in 50-69 year old women. In 1978, for example, approximately 66,000 of the 210,000 deaths in women 50-69 were attributed to heart disease.

Premenopausal women have a lower rate of ischemic heart disease compared to men of similar age. Surgically induced or natural early menopause increases the risk of ischemic heart disease. These facts have focused interest on estrogens as possible mediators of the beneficial effects, and pointed to the need for further study of their relationship to atherosclerosis risk factors.

Estimates from the Lipid Research Clinics Program indicate estrogen use in approximately one third of postmenopausal women. Analysis of Lipid Research Clinics data confirmed that administration of estrogens results in lower plasma low density lipoprotein levels and elevated plasma high density lipoprotein levels. Thus, the ratio of high density lipoprotein/low density lipoprotein levels is substantially increased. Given the inverse relationship between high density lipoprotein levels and coronary heart disease risk, this effect of estrogens on the plasma lipoproteins could be expected to further reduce coronary heart disease risk in women.

Although the bulk of currently available evidence suggests benefit, some controversy concerning the effects of postmenopausal estrogens on morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease persists. Analysis of the Lipid Research Clinics Follow-up Study population indicated a potentially profound beneficial effect of postmenopausal estrogen use. Mortality from all causes decreased considerably in postmenopausal estrogen users, and the effect was most pronounced in hysterectomized and oophorectomized women. Similar results have been observed for cardiovascular deaths. These benefits appeared to be mediated by the higher high density lipoprotein levels associated with postmenopausal estrogen use. Framingham data are the primary sources reporting possible detrimental effects of postmenopausal estrogen use on cardiovascular morbidity; mortality from all cause and cardiovascular disease was not reported to vary by use.

NHLBI convened a Trans-NIH Estrogen Working Group to make recommendations to NHLBI on the feasibility of undertaking a clinical trial of the effects of postmenopausal estrogen use on cardiovascular disease mortality. The Working Group identified a number of important research questions which needed to be answered to elucidate the effects of postmenopausal estrogen use on risk factors for cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. This initiative was the result of the Working Group's deliberations and recommendations.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

There were seven clinical centers and a coordinating center in this randomized, double-blind clinical trial. The women were allocated to one of five treatment arms: placebo; conjugated equine estrogen (CEE), 0.625 milligrams per day; conjugated equine estrogen, 0.625 milligrams per day plus cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 10 milligrams per day for 12 days per month; CEE, 0.625 milligrams per day plus consecutive MPA, 2.5 milligrams per day; CEE, 0.625 milligrams per day plus cyclic micronized progesterone (MP), 200 milligrams per day for 12 days a month. The four primary endpoints were chosen to represent four biological systems related to the risk of cardiovascular disease and included high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), systolic blood pressure, serum insulin, and fibrinogen. Recruitment began in October 1989 and ended in February 1991. Baseline data collected included blood pressure, resting heart rate, weight, waist/hip ratios and endometrial biopsy. Laboratory evaluations included lipid panel, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin and glucose, bone density, fibrinogen, and in three clinics, additional hemostasis factors, renin substrate, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and oral post-heparin lipase activity. All women underwent an endometrial aspiration biopsy at baseline and annually thereafter. Additional biopsy specimens were obtained if there was noncyclic endometrial bleeding. All women also had baseline and annual mammograms. Other data were collected on quality of life, exercise, diet, alcohol use, and smoking. Participants were followed at three, six and twelve months post-randomization, and at six month intervals thereafter for three years. Post-trial analyses of existing data sets were funded for three years by the cooperative agreement mechanism beginning August 1, 1994. A three-year safety follow-up funded through the contract mechanism began in 1994. It included three annual visits at which endometrial biopsies, mammograms, and some limited health information were obtained.

Coronary atherosclerosis begins in childhood and is expressed in adulthood as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or sudden death. The earliest lesion in the vascular system is the fatty streak, characterized by an accumulation of lipids in the intima. These lesions are present in the vessels of infants and young children. Whether these fatty streaks are precursors of more complex lesions is controversial. However, fibrous plaques, intimal lesions consisting of a central core of extracellular lipids covered with a cap of fibromuscular tissue, are frequently seen in children by 15 years of age. In addition, necropsy studies of United States battle casualties confirm the presence of advanced coronary lesions in young adults. Thus, it appears that the atherosclerotic process is well established in the American population by young adulthood.

Epidemiologic studies in adults have found that associated with the development of coronary artery disease are a number of risk factors including age, sex, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes, a family history of coronary artery disease, obesity, lack of physical activity, and perhaps coronary prone behavior. Of the modifiable factors, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and cigarette smoking have the greatest predictive value.

A small reduction of serum cholesterol levels in all children by a modest diet change, it has been hypothesized, would reduce coronary heart disease. More severe dietary restriction, in some cases in conjunction with medication, is recommended for very high-risk pediatric populations only. In addition, surveillance of blood pressure, avoidance of cigarette smoking and overweight, and regular physical exercise are prudent recommendations for all children.

The National Children and Youth Fitness Study (NCYFS) offered new standards for measuring fitness, profiled youth exercise habits, and helped to explain the contribution of exercise to fitness. Nationwide, 8,000 fifth- through twelfth-graders in 140 schools in 19 states participated in the study between February and May 1984. Findings revealed that these youths had substantially more body fat than their counterparts in the 1960's and that approximately half of the students did not perform sufficient physical activity to maintain effective cardiorespiratory functioning. Results from the 1985 national survey of drug use among high school students indicate that most initial experiences with smoking occur before high school, with 13 percent of students beginning prior to tenth grade. Substantial increases in smoking occur between seventh and eighth grade and inner city Hispanic students show higher smoking rates than white or Black inner city youth.

Although there is debate about the cut-off point at which children might be considered at risk for coronary heart disease, it is estimated that 36-60 percent of children in the United States exhibit at least one modifiable risk factor for coronary disease by the age of 12. The nation's schools may provide an appropriate and efficient vehicle for reducing cardiovascular risks in large populations. About 47 million children and young people attend some 115,000 public and private schools. These students are in school from 5 to 8 hours each day, 5 days per week, for nearly 36 weeks per year. Furthermore, the school food services provide 20 percent or more of total daily caloric intake on school days for children who select the school lunch program.

Currently, school-based health promotion programs are conceptualized as including curriculum and related organizational factors that support healthy behavior. The existence of comprehensive programs is limited throughout the nation. The results of numerous school-based nutrition studies report changes in students' knowledge about nutrition. Several studies based on social learning theory report changes in behavior and knowledge about nutrition. Although health education interventions may succeed in increasing children's knowledge and producing changes in behavioral intentions and behavior, the behavioral changes may not be maintained unless the school environment and children's parents reinforce the intentions.

Substantial progress in the field of cigarette smoking prevention in youths has been made during the past few years. Researchers have focused on the prevention of cigarette smoking for several reasons. First, cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for such chronic diseases as coronary heart disease, cancer, and emphysema. Second, cigarette smoking is the most widespread form of drug dependence in our society. Third, cigarette smoking occurs toward the very beginning of the developmental progression of substance abuse and consequently is generally regarded to be one of the so-called 'gateway' substances.

A recent review indicated that the most promising cigarette smoking prevention approaches focus on the psychosocial factors that promote initiation of cigarette smoking. Such approaches fall into two general categories: (a) those that focus on the social influences believed to promote substance use, and (b) those that provide coping skills training designed to enhance personal and social competence. Results of a recent 24-month study involving 689 sixth-grade elementary students showed that youths who received both health information and skills interventions had less intention to smoke and less cigarette use than youths who received no intervention or health information alone. Prior studies using peer-led models with seventh graders report similar results.

The research literature on the effects of physical activity promotion is sparse. One of the few intervention studies on physical activity with school children to report increased endurance fitness and reduced body fat associated with an intensive daily physical program is the Australian Health and Fitness Study. This randomized, controlled trial was designed to compare the effects of integrated physical activity and health education programs on body fat, blood pressure, and endurance fitness in 10-year-old school children in primary schools located in Adelaide. The Oslo Youth Study was successful in designing and implementing within the school system a comprehensive health educational program involving grades 5-7. Positive results were obtained in the intervention group relative to the reference group with reductions in smoking onset, improved eating habits, and increased physical activity over a two-year period.

Over the past ten years, school-based research studies have become more theoretically-grounded and have employed more sophisticated research design strategies and measurement techniques. The prevention of cigarette smoking has been the major focus of this research. There is still considerable need to build the base of scientific knowledge about the development of dietary, smoking, and exercise habits during childhood and about the interventions that are effective in school settings.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

CATCH consisted of a three-and-a-half year feasibility study conducted from September 1987 through March 1991, the main trial beginning in April 1991, and the Tracking Study, in 1996 a follow-up study to allow measurements on the cohort through ages 13 to 14 years. The purpose of the feasibility study was to test the acceptability of the interventions and measurements in 1,471 third, fourth, and fifth grade boys and girls, ages 7 to 11. The main components of the Phase I intervention programs at the eight schools included classroom curricula for the third, fourth, and fifth grades; home curricula designed to involve parents and children in CATCH activities at home and family fun nights to enhance family involvement; a physical activity program centered around a new physical activity curriculum; and a school nutrition program for school food service directors and staff. Blood samples were obtained from 1,045 children during risk factor screening. Other measurements included blood pressure, height, weight, triceps, and subscapular skinfolds. Nutrient intake was pilot-tested with an interactive 24-hour recall approach, supplemented by food records, a home food inventory, and follow-up calls to parents. Physical activity was measured with a physical activity interview and the Caltrac motion sensor.

The main trial or Phase II, beginning in 1991 and ending in 1994, included two study groups, an Intervention Group and a Control Group, with a total of approximately 8,000 students. The measurement cohort included 5,107 students. The Intervention Group received a school-based program consisting of the CATCH curriculum, the physical education program, the school food service program, and programs to establish smoke-free schools. One-half of the Intervention Group received the same school-based program plus a family-based program. The Control Group received the usual health curriculum of the control schools but none of the CATCH interventions. The primary endpoints at the school level were reduction in fat and saturated fat in school lunches and increased moderate to vigorous activity in PE classes. The primary endpoint at the student level was serum cholesterol change between the third and fifth grades. Secondary endpoints included health knowledge, self-efficacy and behavioral skills that related to the adoption and maintenance of cardiovascular health behaviors; dietary fat intake; dietary sodium intake; physical activity; and systolic blood pressure. The unit of randomization was the elementary school. Schools were recruited for participation and then randomly assigned to the study groups. Twenty-four schools were recruited from each of the four participating field centers for a total of 96 schools. In each center, ten of 24 schools were assigned to the Control Group and 14 to the Intervention Group. Among the 14 intervention schools, seven were randomly assigned to the school-based intervention alone and seven to the school-based and family component. Measures of behavioral outcome and process variables were made during each grade from three through five. Physiological measurements were made at baseline in grade three and at the end of grade five. Final measurements were completed in May 1994. Close-out and final data analysis were conducted in the latter part of 1995 and in 1996. The major results paper was published in JAMA in March 1996. Ten major mainstream papers were published in Preventive Medicine in 1996.

The Tracking Study of CATCH III, beginning in December 1994, followed the cohort through early adolescence in the sixth through eighth grades. The objectives were to measure the effects of CATCH II intervention programs on subsequent smoking prevalence rates during the end of the eighth grade and to observe the onset, development, and inter-correlation of cardiovascular risk factors from early to middle adolescence in the cohort. There were no CATCH interventions. Psychosocial measures, dietary fitness, and smoking data were collected annually. The full panel of physiological measures and biochemical validation of smoking was conducted during the last semester of eighth grade. CATCH III ended in November 1999. The study was active through November 2000 under U01-HL-47098, the coordinating center.

In August of 1996, a homocysteine substudy was added to CATCH. The substudy used serum samples collected in eighth graders in the spring of 1997 for analyses of homocysteine, folic acid, vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, lipids, lipoproteins, blood pressure, weight and height. A mail survey was conducted to collect data on the children's family history of cardiovascular disease and vitamin supplementation. The results paper was published in JAMA in 1998.

The CATCH-ON Study began in 1998. It's purpose was to assess the degree to which CATCH intervention goals (reduction of fat and saturated fat in school meals, increase in physical activity, no tobacco use, and implementation of the CATCH curriculum) were maintained or institutionalized in the original 56 CATCH intervention schools and in 20 control schools. CATCH-ON was Phase IV that ended March 31, 2001. To determine the influence of secular trends, the outcome measures were also assessed in 12 newly recruited (unexposed) schools. Measures of school climate, teacher and staff characteristics, school turbulence and school facilities and resources were assessed to help explain the variation in the degree of institutionalization in the CATCH intervention and control schools.",Interventional,Schools from the CATCH Trial (76) or schools unexposed to CATCH (12).,No,All,7 Years,11 Years,

The feasibility of paramedics correctly identifying candidates for thrombolytic therapy following myocardial infarction was assessed in Phase I. In Phase II, pre-hospital thrombolytic therapy was compared with in-hospital thrombolytic therapy.","BACKGROUND:

In the past, patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated by putting them to bed. It was felt that once the symptoms and electrocardiographic signs of acute myocardial infarction had occurred, the process was complete and that the heart and patient at rest would allow the illness to run its course and the heart to heal. The focus of treatment in the Coronary Intensive Care Unit was to prevent complications of acute myocardial infarction, primarily arrhythmias leading to cardiac arrest and the treatment of cardiac arrest itself. Acute phase morbidity and mortality related to loss of myocardium through infarction has not changed. Post-discharge mortality and morbidity is, in large part, related to the occurrence of congestive heart failure, secondary to loss of myocardium to infarction. Efforts to preserve myocardium through pharmacologic intervention to limit demand, have not resulted in significant benefit. It is now recognized that the infarction is not complete on presentation, that it occurs as a wavefront over a period of four to six hours, and that in 80 to 90 percent of patients, infarction is due to thrombus in the infarct-related artery. Therefore, reperfusion of the jeopardized myocardium during this window of four to six hours could result in salvage of myocardium with resultant decrease in acute mortality as well as acute and chronic morbidity and mortality from myocardial failure.

The international streptokinase trials have established the feasibility of intravenous coronary thrombolysis with streptokinase and demonstrated a decrease in acute morality ranging from 18 percent to 50 percent, depending upon the interval between the onset of chest pain and the initiation of thrombolytic therapy. Furthermore, preservation of ventricular function, as reflected in ejection fraction, is greater with early administration.

The TIMI trial of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), which is more clot-specific than streptokinase, has substantiated the effectiveness. The initiation of thrombolytic therapy with TPA as early as possible after the onset of symptoms offers an advantage, therefore, in terms of both a reduction in acute mortality and salvage of ischemic myocardium.

Although thrombolysis is being performed at community hospitals or enroute to hospitals by specially trained teams using helicopter transport, only one major study has been reported which has systematically evaluated the benefit of early on-the-scene thrombolysis. This study documented significant benefit in terms of salvage of myocardium over those patients in whom thrombolytic therapy was initiated after arrival in the hospital, as a direct function of time. This program used physicians in the ambulance to evaluate indications for and contraindications to thrombolytic therapy in the field. The proposed study would evaluate the ability of paramedics, under physician remote control, to accurately evaluate patients in the field in terms of indications and contra-indications to thrombolytic therapy, and to assess the possible benefit in terms of salvage of myocardium in those patients being transported to the hospital by paramedic squads as opposed to those arriving by ordinary means.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

In Phase I, the paramedics took electrocardiograms of patients who met the definition of cases and administered an abbreviated questionnaire. This phase tested the feasibility of paramedics making a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction on the basis of clinical history and with the support of computerized electrocardiogram, coming to an appropriate decision to initiate thrombolytic therapy on the basis of the field database, and recognizing appropriate contraindications to thrombolytic therapy with and without remote physician supervision. An analysis was conducted of the pre-hospital selection of patients for thrombolytic therapy.

Criteria for approval to move to Phase II included correct identification of appropriate cases for treatment 75 percent of the time, less than five percent inappropriate cases or with contraindications for thrombolytic therapy, and no more than one percent of the selected cases found to have initial life-threatening hemorrhagic conditions.

Beginning in November 1988, Phase II compared initiation of thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) in the field to initiation in the hospital. During Phase II, which lasted for 24 months, one half of the patients meeting the case definition received paramedic administration of intravenous thrombolytic therapy and one half received the same pre-hospital diagnostic steps but treatment administered after transport to the hospital. The 360 patients with symptoms for six hours or less, no risk factors for serious bleeding, and ST-segment elevation, were selected by paramedics and a remote physician for inclusion in the trial. They were allocated to aspirin and alteplase treatment initiated before or after hospital arrival. Intravenous sodium heparin was administered to both groups in the hospital. Nineteen hospitals in the Seattle and King County areas participated. The primary endpoint was a ranked composite score (combining death, stroke, serious bleeding, and infarct size). The relation between time to treatment and outcome (composite score, infarct size, ejection fraction, and mortality) was also assessed.

In Phase II, a myocardial infarction registry was established to include all patients hospitalized in the area with a discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. The registry placed the trial findings in a community-based perspective and aided in the interpretation of trial findings by assessing the proportion of cases seeking paramedic care and determining the characteristics of these patients in contrast to those arriving at the hospital by other means. The records of all patients admitted directly to coronary care units in Seattle and King County were surveyed. Study personnel examined differences, if any, between paramedic and other transport groups regarding clinical history, treatment, complications, and hospital discharge rates. Of the cases in the registry, 300 who arrived at the hospital by means other than paramedic transport were compared to the paramedic-transported cases with respect to the incidence of new Q-wave infarction on the first and last electrocardiogram, an interview to determine onset, severity, and duration of symptoms, and reasons for choosing one type of care over the other during the emergency situation.",Interventional,"Men and women, ages 35 to 71, with chest pain of between 15 minutes and 6 hours duration, systolic blood pressure of more than 80 mm Hg and less than 200 mm Hg, and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg.

Also, to determine if a full scale trial was feasible.","BACKGROUND:

At the present time, atherosclerosis of the major extracranial arteries to the brain is considered the cause of most strokes. Early intervention and stroke prevention utilized anti-coagulants such as coumadin and heparin. Results were largely equivocal due to the diverse nature of the underlying pathogenesis and due to problems that offset potential benefit. Emphasis gradually switched to aspirin and to other platelet anti-aggregant drugs because of mounting evidence that micro-emboli were a major element in transient ischemic attacks. Several studies have examined the potential benefit of aspirin in stroke prevention. The exact dose of aspirin that was maximally beneficial with minimal side effects was not completely established. There was evidence that low dose aspirin was as effective as higher doses. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) made recommendations that if aspirin were issued as a primary anti-thrombotic agent, the dose should be 325 mg daily, except in patients with cerebrovascular disease in whom the lowest beneficial dose appeared to be one gram per day. The ACCP also pointed out that the risk of bleeding was substantially greater in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease and venous thromboembolism than in other high risk groups requiring anticoagulation. It advised that anticoagulant therapy was not needed, but that aspirin might be given at 325 mg per day.

Lovastatin is a fungal metabolite that inhibits 3-hydroxy, 3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis in human cells including the liver. Inhibition of this pathway causes the cells to increase their low density lipoprotein receptor numbers to compensate, causing a reduction in circulating low density lipoprotein levels with a consequent drop in circulating plasma cholesterol levels. The drug also raises high density lipoprotein levels significantly. A favorable outcome of the trial will have major public health implications for the prevention and control of atherosclerosis and its complications.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind, factorial design. In this multicenter study, patients were assigned to one of four drug combination groups: active lovastatin/active warfarin, active lovastatin/warfarin placebo, lovastatin placebo/active warfarin, and lovastatin placebo/warfarin placebo. Daily aspirin was recommended for everyone. Ultrasound was performed for screening, at baseline and semiannually thereafter. Lipid profiles were obtained at screening, at baseline, monthly for the first three months, at six months, and annually thereafter, with beta quantification at baseline. Recruitment began in the tenth month of the trial and continued for one year, ending in September 1990. Treatment continued through the 51st month. Average treatment period was 2.7 years. Subjects were offered a dietary regimen for three months prior to receiving any drug therapy. Only those individuals whose lipid levels did not fall below a certain point continued in dietary intervention. The primary outcome measure was the three year change in mean maximum intimal-medial thickness (IMT) in twelve walls of the carotid arteries. Secondary outcomes included change in single maximum IMT and incidence of major cardiovascular events.

In 1995, an R03 was awarded to Mark Espeland to extend analyses of the carotid B-mode ultrasound data through August, 1998.

The pediatric medical community has long been concerned about the increased incidence of cerebral dysfunction among newborns with severe cyanotic congenital heart disease. There has been concern about a great number of potential predisposing factors including the effects of hypoxemia and acidosis, trauma during cardiac catheterization, and the duration of prolonged decreased arterial oxygen saturation. Many infants undoubtedly undergo significant brain damage prior to surgery, but may be subject to further insult in the peri-operative period. The proposed trial studied circulatory arrest versus low-flow bypass methods of surgical support in a homogeneous group of patients who were managed in identical fashion in all other aspects of their treatment. Major factors, such as the influence of cardiac catheterization and presurgical status were specifically incorporated into the primary statistical analysis. This was important in order to identify significant predisposing causes of brain injury beyond the surgical techniques being compared, and to increase the power of the comparison.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, partially blinded. Infants were assigned to deep hypothermia and either circulatory arrest or low-flow bypass support during arterial switch surgical repair of transposition of the great arteries. Randomization was stratified by diagnosis (with or without septal defect) and by specific surgeon of three, thus yielding six strata within each treatment group. Randomization was also blocked to minimize imbalances in treatment assignment between strata. The study was partially blinded, in that outcome data were obtained by investigators who were unaware of management, surgical care, and intensive care were standardized. Hemodynamic assessment was made early in the post-operative period. The outcomes of primary interest (magnetic resonance imaging, neurologic examination, and psychometric testing) were reviewed at the one-year evaluation, to maximize relevance to the long-term prognosis. Pre-operative and seven-to-ten day post-operative neurologic examination was also carried out. Developmental status at one year was measured by the Bayley developmental scales and the Fagan test of infant intelligence. Brain function was assessed by neurologic examination at one year. The recruitment period extended from April 1988 to February 1992.

The trial was extended through December 1997 to allow four years of follow-up. The follow-up allowed the assessment of a primary outcome variable in the neurologic domain and a primary outcome variable in the developmental domain. The primary outcome variable of the neurologic examination resulted in an ordered classification of three categories of normal, minor, and major dysfunction, such as apraxia or cerebral palsy. Development was assessed using standardized measures of cognition, behavior, language, attention, and motor skills. The primary outome variable for the developmental evaluation was the intelligence quotient on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-R). Secondary outcome variables included measurements of behavior and performance in specific domains of speech and language, visual motor integration, attention, motor function, and temperament.

Beginning in January 1998, the study was extended for an additional four years through December 2001 to compare the effects of the two intraoperative methods with respect to developmental and neurologic status at eight years of age. Developmental status was assessed by the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (primary outcome) and by the presence of learning disabilities and performance in specific neuropsychologic domains (secondary outcomes). Neurologic status was determined by neurologic exam (primary outcome) and by specific types of dysfunction such as motor problems. The study also compared the academic and intellectual performance of the cohort at age eight years to population norms and used the data to identify correlates of the children's eight year outcomes, as well as their development between ages one and eight.",Interventional,"Boy and girl infants, up to three months of age, with transposition of the great arteries with or without septal defect.",No,All,,1 Year,Infant Heart Surgery: Central Nervous System Sequelae of Circulatory Arrest

The trial was the first randomized, controlled trial to determine whether patients outside a hospital could be motivated to make and sustain comprehensive lifestyle changes and whether coronary disease regression could occur as a result of lifestyle changes alone.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Patients were randomly assigned to an experimental group or to a usual-care group. Experimental-group patients were prescribed a lifestyle program including a low-fat vegetarian diet, moderate aerobic exercise, stress management training, stopping smoking, and group support. No animal products were allowed in the vegetarian diet except egg white and one cup per day of non-fat milk or yogurt. The diet contained approximately 10 percent of calories as fat. Control-group patients were not asked to make lifestyle changes. Coronary angiography was performed at baseline and at one year to assess progression or regression of disease. Patients were recruited into the trial between January 1986 and November 1988. The trial was supported prior to April 1989 from various sources other than the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Follow-up continued for four years.

There was also a registry with two components. A roster enumerated all patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction enrolled at cooperating hospitals. From the roster, a study population of 1,893 subjects was selected and followed prospectively for the year to determine incidence of death or myocardial infarction.","BACKGROUND:

TIMI IIIA and TIMI IIIB follow the contract-supported clinical trial, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI I, TIMI IIA, and TIMI II).

Myocardial ischemic syndromes account for a large portion of the annual mortality and morbidity from all causes in industrialized countries and encompass a wide clinical-pathologic spectrum. At one end of this spectrum are patients with chronic stable angina. When studied by coronary arteriography, such patients usually have obstructive atherosclerotic disease with no evidence of fresh thrombosis. At the other end of the spectrum are patients with acute myocardial infarction who present with a discrete episode of prolonged chest pain accompanied by persistent ST-segment elevation. Such patients have a high incidence of thrombotic coronary artery occlusion and the early intravenous administration of thrombolytic agents has been shown to re-establish perfusion, limit the extent of left ventricular dysfunction, and reduce both early or in-hospital and late or one year mortality in this group.

Patients with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and unstable angina fall between these two extremes. In the days and weeks following the onset of their disorder, their prognosis for survival is better than that of patients with Q-wave myocardial infarction but worse than that of patients with stable angina. Some patients with unstable angina progress to acute myocardial infarction, and some of those with non-Q-wave infarction experience an unstable course with reinfarction. Although others recover from the acute episode without subsequent infarction or reinfarction, they frequently have severe obstructive coronary artery disease and may be left with severe chronic stable angina. National summaries of hospital records indicate that 750,000 patients are hospitalized yearly with unstable angina and 250,000 with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.

Once the results of creatine kinase measurements and serial electrocardiograms are available, the identification of patients experiencing non-Q-wave myocardial infarction is relatively simple. Identification of patients experiencing unstable angina is more difficult, since numerous definitions of the condition have been offered. There is agreement, however, on two important features of unstable angina. First, ischemia usually develops at rest or is precipitated by minimal exertion; this differs from chronic stable angina, in which most ischemic episodes are precipitated by physical exertion or strong emotion and the resultant increase in myocardial oxygen demand. Second, ischemia is often associated with transient ST-segment depression or elevation, in contrast to the persistent ST-segment elevation characteristic of patients who develop Q-wave infarction.

It has been observed in small numbers of patients that, unlike patients with chronic stable ischemia, patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction frequently have a thrombus in a major coronary artery. Initial conventional therapy for unstable angina consists of bed rest, oxygen, nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and aspirin. The use of heparin is widespread but controversial. In many tertiary care hospitals, angiography followed by PTCA is frequently performed, whereas in community hospitals patients are often managed without angiography.

Prior to the TIMI III trial, patients with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction were usually treated in the same way patients with Q-wave myocardial infarction were treated prior to the advent of thrombolytic therapy. Neither heparin therapy nor thrombolytic therapy was routinely employed, although knowledge of the role of thrombosis in some patients with this condition had raised the possibility that one or both approaches might be helpful. Although the early prognosis was favorable, awareness that the longer-term prognosis was as serious as that following Q-wave myocardial infarction had led to increasing use of follow-up coronary angiography to identify patients for whom PTCA or CABG might be useful. Whether or not revascularization improved prognosis in these patients had not been established.

Previous studies of thrombolytic therapy for unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction were limited in number and size. The results suggested a benefit, but the significance of this benefit and its relation to the risks and costs of therapy remained to be answered. Also, the value of routine, early coronary angiography followed by PTCA and/or CABG was still unclear in both these conditions.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The two clinical trials were initiated simultaneously in different groups of TIMI III clinical centers. All patients enrolled in the study received standard coronary care unit care, including bed rest and oxygen. In TIMI IIIA, patients received baseline angiograms and were randomized in a double-blind manner to t-PA or placebo. All patients then received intravenous heparin. The primary endpoint was the number of patients with a successful result of therapy, defined as an improvement in TIMI perfusion by two grades (from 0 to 2 or 3, or from 1 to 3) or a ten percent reduction in the severity of stenosis. The reduction was based on a comparison between the baseline angiogram and the follow-up angiogram obtained 18 to 48 hours later. Patients in TIMI IIIA were enrolled over a nine month period. The total duration was 24 months, including 12 months of data analysis.

In TIMI IIIB, a total of 1,473 patients seen within 24 hours of ischemic chest pain at rest, considered to represent unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (NQMI), were randomized using a 2 x 2 factorial design to compare t-PA versus placebo as initial therapy and an early invasive strategy consisting of early coronary arteriography followed by revascularization when the anatomy was suitable versus an early conservative strategy consisting of coronary arteriography followed by revascularization if initial medical therapy failed. All patients were treated with bed rest, anti-ischemic medications, aspirin, and heparin. The primary endpoint for the t-PA placebo comparison was death, myocardial infarction, or failure of initial therapy at six weeks. Randomization began in October 1989 and concluded in June 1992. The primary endpoint for the early invasive and early conservative strategies was death, post randomization myocardial infarction or an unsatisfactory exercise tolerance test (ETT) at six weeks.

Coronary angioplasty is a non-surgical means of mechanical coronary artery revascularization with the potential of reducing or eliminating severe coronary arterial narrowing which results in myocardial ischemia. Since its innovation, the technique of coronary angioplasty has undergone continuous refinement, so that a greater proportion of patients are now eligible for this increasingly successful procedure. All clinical syndromes associated with coronary artery disease, including chronic stable angina, silent myocardial ischemia, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction, have been successfully treated with this therapy, and often dramatic, favorable results are achieved. A persistent limitation of the procedure has been the development of restenosis or the recurrence of coronary arterial narrowing which usually occurs within six months of successful balloon dilatation, in spite of current treatments such as anti-platelet agents. Several clinical trials have attempted to identify pharmacologic regimens aimed at reducing the incidence of restenosis. With rare exception, these trials have failed to detect a positive effect of any drug intervention. Considering that restenosis reflects multiple factors, such as thrombosis, spasm, an exaggerated response to injury, smooth muscle cells, platelets, and components of arachidonic acid metabolism, multiple pharmacologic therapies have been employed, including aspirin, warfarin, heparin, calcium antagonists, and steroids.

Investigators have directed attention to the potential role of marine polyunsaturated fatty acids as potential inhibitors of restenosis. Dietary fish oil has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation and stimulate thromboxane synthesis, to reduce platelet vascular interactions in atherosclerotic and injured blood vessels, and to inhibit diet-induced atherogenesis in swine and in two species of monkeys. One study has shown that dietary fish oil administered to pigs reduced platelet deposition and vasoconstriction in balloon catheter induced carotid artery lesions. In addition, fish oil reduces blood and red cell viscosity and also inhibits the function of monocytes which may be important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis or in the vascular response to injury.

Early reports from human studies have been mixed, with most investigations failing to demonstrate a positive effect. However, these trials have been limited to small numbers of patients and typically lacked the rigor of a randomized, controlled clinical trial with a hard endpoint and aggressive administration of fatty acids. N-3 PUFAs have been reported in humans to increase prostacyclin formation and plasma fibrinolytic activity and to reduce serum lipids, vascular reactivity, and the inflammatory potential of white blood cells at the site of vascular injury, factors potentially involved in restenosis post-PTCA. Therefore, there was some reason to believe that the addition of n-3 PUFAs to aspirin might have a greater effect upon restenosis of treated vessels than aspirin alone. The basis of this study rested with epidemiologic data from the Eskimos and Japanese that the ingestion of n-3 PUFAs derived from cold water marine sources has a favorable effect in preventing the development of coronary artery disease.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind. Patients at eight centers were assigned to receiving for six months a daily dietary supplement of fish oil (ten 1.0-g capsules containing 80.6 percent ethyl esters of omega-3 fatty acids providing 4.1 g eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and 2.8 g docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) or to a control group receiving corn oil. The high dose of fish oil approached the intake of the Greenland Inuits and was chosen with the hope of overcoming any antagonistic effects of other fatty acids competing with those of EPA or DHA, such as arachidonic acid or saturated fats. Two weeks prior to PTCA, patients began to take the capsules. Aspirin was initiated 12 hours prior to PTCA and continued for six months. Dietary counseling was provided prior to the two week intervention. Upon admission for PTCA and one week following PTCA, expanded dietary counseling and instruction were given. Patients were telephoned monthly to reinforce dietary information which included the American Heart Association Phase I diet to reduce total fat to 30 percent of total energy. Diet was not rigidly controlled. Recruitment began in August 1989 and ended in September 1992. Patients exited from the trial upon completion of the protocol, including a final set of evaluations at six months.

Numerous observational epidemiologic studies have established ethanol intake as one of the most important determinants of blood pressure levels. However, data from intervention studies were very limited.

The study was an inter-agency agreement involving the Veterans Administration and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). Protocol development occurred between October 1988 and June 1989. The protocol was approved by the VA Cooperative Studies Evaluation Committee in July 1989 and reviewed by a separate Data and Safety Monitoring Board in September 1989.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Subjects were randomized to intervention or control groups. Intervention aimed to reduce alcohol intake to no more than 14 drinks per week and 50 percent or less of each participant's baseline level. The intervention technique consisted of a cognitive-behavioral program, the intensive phase of which consisted of six counseling sessions over three months. Echocardiograms were obtained at baseline and six months after randomization. Biochemical markers were used to validate changes in alcohol consumption. The trial included an eighteen-month feasibility phase with six-month follow-up and a 36-month main trial with two years of follow-up. Recruitment for the full-scale trial ended in June 1993. Final study visits were conducted in September and October 1994.

The prevalence of congestive heart failure increases progressively with advancing age, and congestive heart failure is a major cause of mortality, morbidity, and diminished quality of life in the elderly. Not only is congestive heart failure the most common cardiovascular indication for hospitalization in patients 65 years or older, but frequent repetitive hospitalizations, occurring in 30-50 percent of patients within three to six months of initial discharge, create an imposing cost burden in caring for these patients. A pilot study conducted at the grantee institution has shown that elderly congestive heart failure patients at risk for early readmission can be identified at the time of initial hospitalization, that up to 50 percent of readmissions are potentially preventable, and that a non-pharmacologic treatment strategy consisting of patient education, medication analysis, discharge planning, and enhanced follow-up is feasible and may reduce readmissions by 30 to 50 percent.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

In the feasibility study, patients were randomly assigned to receive intervention or standard care over a four year period. Patients were stratified into readmission risk categories of high or moderate based on the presence of four independent risk factors for readmission defined in a prior study at Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. The risk factors included: four or more prior hospitalizations within the preceding five-year interval, previous history of congestive heart failure, hypocholesterolemia, and right bundle-branch block on the admitting electrocardiogram. The study intervention consisted of individualized patient education using teaching materials specifically designed for the study; a careful review of medications with specific recommendations designed to eliminate unnecessary drugs, decrease the number of dosing intervals, improve compliance, and minimize side effects; early discharge planning; and enhanced post-discharge follow-up. The primary endpoints were rehospitalization within 90 days after initial hospital discharge and the cumulative number of days hospitalized during follow-up. Principal secondary endpoints included analyses of the effect of the study intervention on compliance with prescribed medications, dietary sodium intake, incidence of adverse drug reactions, patient knowledge and understanding of congestive heart failure, patient-assessed quality of life, and the overall cost of medical care.

In the full-scale trial, 140 patients were assigned to the control group which received all standard treatments and services ordered by their physicians. A total of 142 patients were assigned to the treatment group which received intensive education about congestive heart failure and its treatment by an experienced cardiovascular research nurse, using a teaching booklet developed by study investigators for geriatric patients with heart failure. Treatment group patients also received individualized dietary assessment and instruction given by a registered dietitian; consultation with social-service personnel to facilitate discharge planning and care after discharge; an analysis of medications by a geriatric cardiologist who made specific recommendations to eliminate unnecessary medications and simplify the overall regimen; and intensive follow-up after discharge. The goals of follow-up were to reinforce the patient's education, ensure compliance with medications and diet, and identify recurrent symptoms amenable to treatment on an outpatient basis. The primary outcome measure was survival for 90 days without hospital readmission. Secondary endpoints included the number of readmissions for any cause, the number of readmissions for congestive heart failure, the cumulative number of days of hospitalization during follow-up, quality-of-life scores, and the overall cost of medical care.

Despite widespread use of digitalis and its availability for nearly two centuries, uncertainty surrounded the appropriateness of its role and value in treating congestive heart failure patients in sinus rhythm. The study was a multicenter collaborative effort with the Department of Veteran Affairs Cooperative Studies Program which provided support for a data coordinating center and a pharmacy coordinating center.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind, simple, multicenter, international trial with 186 centers in the United States and 116 in Canada. In the main trial, patients with left ventricular ejection fractions of 0.45 or less were randomly assigned to digoxin (3397 patients) or placebo (3403 patients) in addition to diuretics and ACE inhibitors. In an ancillary trial of patients with ejection fractions greater than 0.45, 492 patients were randomly assigned to digoxin and 496 to placebo. Patients were recruited over a three-year period at the 302 centers and followed for a minimum of two years. Patient enrollment began in February 1991 and ended in September 1993. Follow-up ended in December 1995. The main results paper was published in 1997.

Three substudies were conducted. The quality of life/6-minute walk test substudy determined the effect of treatment on a patient's well-being, daily activities, and functional status. The Holter/signal averaging electrocardiogram substudy examined the pathophysiology of sudden cardiac death.

Circulating levels of cholesterol, specifically cholesterol associated with the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) fraction, have been established by observational epidemiologic studies and by metabolic, pathologic, genetic studies in humans and selected animal models, and by randomized clinical trials as a major etiologic factor in coronary heart disease. The ratio between the percent reduction in coronary heart disease incidence and the percent reduction in cholesterol levels associated with treatment in randomized trials, approximately 2:1, is almost exactly that predicted by numerous observational epidemiologic studies of this relationship. However, the clinical trials demonstrating that lowering LDL-cholesterol levels reduces subsequent incidence of coronary heart disease events have been confined by and large to middle-aged men with hypercholesterolemia as in the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (LRC-CPPT) or to men with established coronary heart disease as in the Coronary Drug Project (CDP). Experimental confirmation that cholesterol-lowering treatment is worthwhile after as well as before age 60 is lacking. Thus, although the guidelines issued in October 1987 by the National Cholesterol Education Program's (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults did not discriminate explicitly by age, the absence of direct evidence of efficacy led them to allow room for physician judgment in applying their recommendations to older patients. This uncertainty in the application of the NCEP guidelines to older men and women is a matter of considerable consequence to the public health.

Epidemiologic studies suggest that the prognostic power of cholesterol levels diminishes with advancing age. Subdivision of the participants in several cohort studies into those above or below age 50 at entry shows that the increment in coronary heart disease risk per increment in total or LDL cholesterol level is nearly always substantially lower in the older group. In the Framingham Heart Study, the study with the most follow-up data beyond age 60, a 0.5 percent increment in the coronary heart disease incidence rate was estimated per 1 mg/dl increment in plasma cholesterol level -- about 60 percent of the increment seen in middle-aged men and women. However, the absolute numbers of potentially preventable coronary heart disease deaths, 80 percent of which occur after age 65, and myocardial infarctions attributable to high plasma cholesterol levels in Framingham and other observational studies appear to increase with increasing age.

Previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering drugs have been weakened by their limited efficacy and acceptability to patients. In older patients, the administration of cholesterol-lowering drugs may be further complicated by interactions with drugs taken for other more pressing conditions. However, since the Food and Drug Administration approved the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, in September 1987, the agent has been efficacious and well-tolerated by patients of all ages, and has been used increasingly widely.

In 1986, an ad hoc committee of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Atherosclerosis, Hypertension, and Lipid Metabolism Advisory Committee (AHLMAC) recommended a randomized clinical trial of cholesterol-lowering using an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor in the elderly. The recommendation was endorsed by the full AHLMAC and approved by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council (NHLBAC) in May 1987. However, due to the high cost of such a trial and concerns about feasibility, an initiative for a two-year pilot study at five clinical centers was developed and approved by the NHLBAC in September 1988. The Request for Applications was released in February 1989 and awards made in July 1990.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

There were five clinical centers and a coordinating center in the pilot study. There were four pre-randomization visits at four to six week intervals. Subjects were eligible for inclusion if their LDL cholesterol levels remained above 120 mg/dl after the introduction of the American Heart Association Step 1 Diet at Visit 2. Subjects were randomized to diet plus a low dosage of lovastatin (20 mg), diet plus a high dosage of lovastatin (40 mg), or to diet plus a placebo. End points were changes in blood lipid levels. Data on other blood chemistry values, as well as quality-of-life measures and coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality, were also collected. LDL cholesterol levels were measured at clinic visits six and twelve weeks after randomization and at twelve week intervals thereafter. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels were measured at six week intervals to determine liver function and slit lamp exams were performed before and after study medication to detect lenticular opacities. Subjects were followed for a minimum of six months and a maximum of fifteen months.

Asymptomatic cardiac ischemia, frequently designated as silent myocardial ischemia, refers to episodes of objectively demonstrable transient ischemia in the absence of symptoms. Annually, more than one million patients suffer acute myocardial infarction. Of the approximately 700,000 who are discharged alive from the hospital, as many as 180,000 will be asymptomatic but have evidence of myocardial ischemia on a pre-discharge exercise test. Asymptomatic ischemia has been linked with sudden death or myocardial infarction. It is estimated that in the United States over six million patients have chronic, symptomatic coronary heart disease and up to three million of these may exhibit transient asymptomatic myocardial ischemia. Asymptomatic ischemia is thought to be present in the majority of coronary heart disease patients with stable angina pectoris, over 70 percent of all ischemic episodes being asymptomatic. Asymptomatic ischemia following myocardial infarction or in the presence of chronic stable angina may be associated with substantially increased morbidity and mortality

Traditionally, treatment of patients with coronary heart disease has been given for and guided by patients' symptoms. There was a growing trend toward recognizing asymptomatic cardiac ischemia and according it importance equal to that of symptomatic ischemia. Many physicians believed that suppression of asymptomatic ischemia in patients with coronary heart disease would reduce morbidity and mortality. This was leading to rapidly increasing and widespread applications of both medical and revascularization therapies.

In 1989, there was a lack of knowledge as to the relative efficacy of different treatment strategies to control asymptomatic cardiac ischemia. Given the estimated high prevalence of asymptomatic cardiac ischemia in patients with coronary heart disease and evidence of increased risk of untoward outcome, the public health problem was of sufficient magnitude to warrant a pilot study to determine to what extent asymptomatic ischemia could be controlled. If the pilot study demonstrated feasibility, a full-scale clinical trial would then be considered to evaluate the impact of effective treatment of asymptomatic ischemia on survival and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

A total of 1,959 patients were screened by AECG monitoring; 49 percent had asymptomatic ischemia, and 65 percent were enrolled in the study. The 618 patients were randomized to one of the three treatment strategies: 202 to angina-guided medical strategy with titration of anti-ischemic medication to relieve angina; 202 to angina-guided plus AECG ischemia-guided medical strategy with titration of anti-ischemic medication to eliminate both angina and AECG ischemia; and 212 to revascularization by angioplasty or bypass surgery. Patients able to take either beta-adrenergic blocking agents or calcium antagonists were also randomized to receive one of two medical combination regimens: atenolol plus nifedipine or diltiazem plus isosorbide dinitrate. Those who could be treated with only one regimen, such as asthmatic patients, were assigned to the appropriate regimen. The primary outcome was the absence of ischemia at twelve weeks.

Various doses of aspirin have been shown to be effective in preventing thrombosis or vascular occlusion in several clinical conditions. Short-term studies have documented the efficacy of aspirin in preventing occlusion of saphenous vein bypass grants, preventing myocardial infarction in patients with unstable angina, preventing transient ischemic attacks and stroke in men with cerebral vascular disease, preventing occlusion of injured coronary arteries following transluminal angioplasty and aiding in reducing myocardial infarction and total mortality in patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy. Additionally, aspirin has been effective in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction in subjects with known coronary artery disease. The results of the Physicians' Health Study, a large-scale primary prevention trial of aspirin in male physicians, have shown a decrease in myocardial infarction, a non-significant increase in cerebral vascular events, and no difference in overall mortality. However, few studies have addressed the efficacy of aspirin in vascular diseases in women, and it is possible that the risk to benefit ratio may be different in women. Specifically, there have been no large primary prevention trials in women, who are at risk of coronary heart disease, especially after menopause.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The Women's Health Study (WHS) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using a 2x2 factorial design. The WHS is sponsored by both NHBLI (HL080467) and NCI (CA047988). Approximately 1.75 million female health professionals were contacted by mail to determine if they were suitable for inclusion in the study. A three-month run-in phase was performed to screen out those with poor compliance. Randomization, which began in February 1993 and ended in January 1996, was stratified on five-year age groups. A total of 39,876 participants were randomly assigned to either Vitamin E (600 IU every other day) or placebo; and to aspirin (100 mg every other day) or placebo. IN the 2x2 factorial design, women were randomly assigned to active aspirin and placebo vitamin E (n=9,968), placebo aspirin and active vitamin E (n=9,971), active aspirin and active vitamin E (n=9,966), or placebo aspirin and placebo vitamin E (n=9,971). A description of the characteristics of women in these 4 groups is provided in J Women's Health Gend Based Med 2000;9:19-27. In the main analyses, all women on active aspirin (n=19,934) were compared to women on placebo aspirin (n=19,942); and all women on active vitamin E (n=19,937) were compared to women on placebo aspirin (n=19,939).

As part of the initial trial, pre-randomization blood samples from 28,345 participants were frozen and stored for genetic analysis which has been supported by non-federal sources.

The primary endpoint is the reduction of the risk of all important vascular events (a combined endpoint of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and total cardiovascular death) and a decrease in the incidence of total malignant neoplasms of epithelial cell origin. Secondary endpoints are the individual components of the combined endpoints. Compliance is measured by replies to a questionnaire sent out every year. The trial was completed in 2004 and results were published in 2005 (N Engl J Med 2005;352:1293-304; JAMA 2005;294:47-55; JAMA 2005;294:56-65).

The study included a controlled clinical trial and a registry.,"BACKGROUND:

Cardiac arrest (sudden cardiac death) occurs relatively frequently in asymptomatic patients who have had myocardial infarctions, have ejection fractions less than 40 percent, and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. However, it is not possible to predict who will die suddenly or when cardiac arrest will occur. Current efforts to reduce sudden death in such long-term survivors of myocardial infarction or in patients with coronary disease have produced results that are not very encouraging.

Such patients may feel quite well. They survived their myocardial infarction and may have slight or even moderate reduction of exercise ability, but by 'pacing' themselves, such patients can lead relatively normal lives. They may be aware of their arrhythmia because of short periods of palpitations which may only trouble them transiently. Consequently, this group of patients, many still in the prime of their lives, are at relatively high risk of dying suddenly.

The multicenter trial may reveal the most effective treatment for such patients, the value of electrophysiologic studies in predicting who is most at risk of sudden cardiac death, and whether electrophysiologic studies can help select the best mode of treatment. The protocol for performing programmed stimulation and serial drug testing is designed to mirror those currently in use by many practicing electrophysiologists.

Randomized, non-blind. Patients were assigned to standard therapy or to an aggressive arm consisting of electrophysiologic-guided antiarrhythmic therapy. Patients in the aggressive arm whose ventricular tachycardia was suppressible or who were still inducible, but who were hemodynamically stable in ventricular tachycardia, were followed on drug therapy. Otherwise, patients in the aggressive arm received an implantable defibrillator. The primary endpoint was sudden cardiac death or cardiac arrest. Patients without inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia were followed in a registry. Recruitment ceased on October 31, 1996 after a recommendation from the DSMB.

The Request for Proposal for the Women's Health Trial: Feasibility Study in Minority Populations was developed and released by the National Cancer Institute with assistance from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized. Recruitment began in August 1992 and ended in February 1994. Forty percent of the subjects were randomized to a control group and 60 percent to the dietary intervention group. Dietary counseling aimed to reduce total fat to 20 percent of calories, reduce saturated fat and dietary cholesterol intakes, and to increase the intake of fruits, vegetables, and grain products. Recruitment and randomization were conducted over an 18-month period at three clinical centers. Other objectives of the trial included: development and evaluation of strategies for recruiting and retaining women of different racial and SES groups into a dietary intervention study; identification of factors affecting compliance; assessment of the effects of a modified fat eating pattern on cardiovascular disease risk factors, including fasting blood lipids and lipoproteins, glucose and insulin, body weight and blood pressure; identification and assessment of potential biochemical and/or biological markers for dietary adherence.

Correlation of high levels of serum cholesterol with an increased incidence and prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) was demonstrated--prior to the inception of the Coronary Drug Project--repeatedly in prospective and cross-sectional epidemiological surveys (e.g., the Tecumseh Study, the Framingham Heart Disease Study). These findings led to the question of whether long-term lowering of serum lipids in individuals both with and without CHD would have a beneficial effect on morbidity and mortality.

The Coronary Drug Project was designed to answer the question of secondary prevention. In 1961, Dr. Robert Wilkins (Boston University School of Medicine) chaired an ad hoc committee which determined the desirability and feasibility of the conduct of this study. Following National Heart Advisory Council (NHAC) support, a study Policy Board, Steering Committee, and Coordinating Center were established and a detailed protocol was written.

In 1964, NHAC approved the project and the NHI recommendation for implementation; the study was begun in 1965. Supported by the grant mechanism, the trial involved 53 participating clinics, a coordinating center, central laboratory, ECG center, drug procurement and distribution center, and NHI medical liaison office, and a policy board, steering committee, and 12 other committees (e.g., a data and safety monitoring committee).

The first patient was randomly allocated to treatment in March 1966 and the last in October 1969. Each patient reported to the clinic every 4 months for a follow-up visit.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind, fixed sample. A total of 8,341 patients were randomly assigned to six treatment groups consisting of 2.5 mg/day of conjugated estrogens, 5.0 mg/day of conjugated estrogens, 1.8 gm/day of clofibrate, 6.0 mg/day of dextrothyroxine sodium, 3.0 gm/day of niacin, or 3.8 gm/day of lactose placebo.

Three of the CDP treatments (two doses of estrogen and dextrothyroxine) were stopped prematurely because of toxicity. At the time the treatments were stopped, it was thought that future assessment of the status of patients on those treatments would be important to evaluate long-term sequellae. Another clinical trial evaluating clofibrate for primary prevention found that more patients on that treatment than on placebo had died. This effect persisted even after the treatment was stopped. Therefore, it was considered necessary to follow the CDP patients on clofibrate.

Of the original 834l patients, about 6000 were still alive in March l975. Cause-specific mortality in those patients was assessed through March l980.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The vital status of the subjects known to be alive at the end of the CDP in March l975 was assessed as of March l980. This was accomplished through questioning the local investigators, letters to the subjects, and by use of Social Security Administration and National Death Index records.

During its course, the trial also obtained a direct measure of the prevalence, severity, and treatment status of representative white and black populations with high blood pressure in these 14 communities, and obtained an estimate of the extent of attainable reduction of complications of high blood pressure by an organized screening and blood pressure management program.","BACKGROUND:

Published data from the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study of Hypertension demonstrated that reduction in morbidity and mortality could be attained by treating men with fixed diastolic blood pressure over 105 mm Hg. Similar trends occurred for those with fixed diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 104 mm Hg. Results and current trends from other studies supported these findings. However, prior to inception of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program (HDFP), it was not known whether benefits from antihypertensive therapy applied to all hypertensives in the general population and whether making use of existing medical knowledge could significantly reduce morbidity and mortality from hypertension in communities.

Recognizing this need, NHLBI initiated the pilot activities of the HDFP to characterize significant operational, socioeconomic, and motivational factors that would influence the acceptance of antihypertensive therapy in the defined populations within which the controlled clinical trial would take place and to obtain baseline information necessary to the undertaking of the clinical trial, which was to determine whether a practical, intensive, and antihypertensive program could significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in hypertensives in the general population.

The planning of the trial, including the development of a protocol and manual of operations, began in 1971. Between February 1973 and May 1974, 158,906 persons were screened for high blood pressure in 14 communities. A total of 10,940 hypertensive participants were randomized.

The primary hypothesis tested by the trial was that intensive blood pressure control under stepped care for five years could significantly reduce mortality compared with that under referred-care. Stepped-care was the method of treatment in HDFP clinics in which a diuretic was given initially and additional antihypertensive agents were added in a time-structured, stepwise fashion until goal blood pressure was achieved. Referred-care represented referral to private physicians and other community sources of care. Participating in this study were 14 clinical centers, a coordinating center, ECG center, central laboratory, and monitoring laboratory.

The clinical phase of the trial ended in May 1982. The project was extended into 1983 in order to continue the surveillance of mortality and blood pressure control.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The trial was a randomized, non-blind, fixed sample trial with single intervention and control groups. The intervention group received stepped care from the clinical trial clinics (see Background, below), while those in the control group were referred to their own physicians. Each community contributed both stepped-care and referred-care participants, but for analysis purposes, the groups were pooled into two groups. The primary endpoint was mortality. The effects of stepped- vs. referred-care were also assessed on intermediate and secondary factors, including nosologic codes of specific causes of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertensive heart disease, and EKG abnormalities.",Interventional,"Men and women, ages 30-69.

Angina pectoris is a symptomatic condition of attacks of chest pain, often debilitating. It is caused by a decreased supply of blood to the heart, such as that which might occur in coronary artery disease. The usual treatment of angina pectoris is designed to relieve the symptoms. It includes avoidance of activities that produce the discomfort and the use of nitroglycerin and beta blocking drugs. Soon after the introduction of coronary bypass surgery, many doctors enthusiastically adopted this approach in treating patients with unstable angina.

In 1972, emphasizing that there was no definitive evidence showing the superiority of intensive medical management or coronary bypass surgery in determining mortality and morbidity in patients hospitalized with unstable angina, some of the participating groups in the NHLBI Myocardial Infarction Research Units developed a cooperative clinical trial to compare these medical and surgical approaches to therapy.

From 1972 through 1976, 288 patients were entered into this randomized clinical trial. One hundred forty-seven patients received intensive pharmacological medical therapy, and 141 comparable patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. Careful follow-up studies were performed on patients in both groups, in-hospital and during the post-hospital phase. These studies included, apart from routine physical examinations, resting electrocardiograms, chest x-ray films, and grade exercise tolerance tests at six months and twelve months.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Research findings from prospective epidemiological studies in a number of populations in the United States over the past 40 years have convincingly established that elevated blood cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and cigarette smoking are risk factors associated with accelerated development of myocardial infarction, sudden death, and death from coronary heart disease. These are not the only risk factors associated with premature development of CHD, but these factors are modifiable and provide a strong expectation that a reduction of these factors should have a beneficial result of reducing the rate of development of premature heart attacks.

A multifactor approach to risk factor reduction closely resembles the type of intervention that would be carried out by a physician in his treatment of a patient. The general concept for such a trial was endorsed by the Arteriosclerosis Task Force in its 1970 report to the Institute.

Volunteers were selected for the trial through a series of three screening visits, which began in November 1973 and were completed by February 28, 1976. From among 361,662 men seen at first screening, 12,866 were found to be eligible and were randomized into the trial. Half of the participants were assigned to the special intervention group and half to the usual care group. The special intervention group was advised to follow an eating pattern designed to result in a nutrient intake of 30 percent to 35 percent of calories from fat, with 10 (later 8) percent from saturated and 10 percent from polyunsaturated fat; approximately 300 (later 250) mg of cholesterol; and modification of carbohydrates as needed for individual requirements. This group was also encouraged to cease cigarette smoking by a combination of techniques, including counseling and audio-visual aids. Hypertension management was based on a stepped-care program of weight reduction and drugs similar to that used in the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program. Those in the usual care group were referred to their personal physician or other source of care for such management of their risk factors as considered appropriate by these providers. The primary endpoint was death due to coronary heart disease. Men in both the special intervention and usual care groups returned for assessment of changes in risk factor levels annually. A medical history was taken and a physical examination performed. An electrocardiogram was also obtained for centralized reading to identify non-fatal myocardial infarction as an additional endpoint.

Participating in the study were 22 clinical centers across the United States, a coordinating center, central laboratory, two ECG reading centers, and lipid standardization laboratory, as well as a drug distribution center. The trial has concluded, with the main mortality results published in September l982. Active follow-up was terminated on schedule on February 28, l982, with final determination of vital status as of that date accomplished for 99.6 percent of the study population.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

A randomized, non-blind design with two groups and fixed sample size. The experimental group underwent a modified-fat diet, antihypertensive therapy, and education related to lifestyle and smoking. Those in the control group were referred to their own physicians for treatment.

Post-trial mortality surveillance of the 12,300 participants still living at the end of active intervention in February 1982 continued through June 1998 under grant support (R01HL43232).

Total dollars spent on the CPPT from June 1973 were $142,250,000. We do not have a year-by-year breakdown.","BACKGROUND:

Numerous prospective epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic coronary heart disease. Research on animals indicating that the reduction of serum cholesterol prevented or reversed atherosclerosis had not been shown convincingly in humans. The Coronary Primary Prevention Trial tested the hypothesis that lowering the serum cholesterol in patients who had no existing evidence of coronary heart disease would reduce the subsequent rate of coronary heart disease in those persons.

Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death and a major cause of morbidity in the United States. The very slow development of the underlying arterial disease and its frequently sudden onset and quickly fatal course necessitate a preventive approach if substantial inroads are to be made. The positive result from the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (CPPT) has done much to resolve the controversy regarding the benefits of lipid-lowering, and should lead to firm advice for high-risk hypercholesterolemic subjects and for the population as a whole.

The CPPT was part of the Institute's Lipid Research Clinic Program under the Lipid Metabolism Branch, DHVD, NHLBI. Twelve lipid research clinics in the United States and Canada participated in this trial, as well as a coordinating center, a central electrocardiographic laboratory, central lipid and clinical chemistry laboratories, a nutrition coding center, and a group of consultants on recruitment and adherence. This program's objectives included the development of standardized methods and definitions for the diagnosis of hyperlipoproteinemia and the performance of a series of collaborative studies of the prevalence and natural history of this disorder, as well as the design and implementation of the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial.

The protocol for the trial was approved in November 1972. Beginning in July 1973, men with hypercholesterolemia were recruited as potential trial subjects from such diverse sources as physician referrals, blood bank donor lists, and mass screening programs. Each subject was screened further in a series of four visits, the purpose of which was to select only men (1) whose lipid abnormality was of the primary Type II phenotype, (2) who were free of clinically manifest coronary heart disease, and (3) whose excellent overall health and reliability made 7-10 years of follow-up a realistic objective. Additionally, a standardized limited-cholesterol/saturated fat diet was initiated at the second of these visits in order to exclude men whose cholesterol levels were highly responsive to diet. Subjects who met all the selection criteria were randomly assigned, in a double-blind fashion, to receive either the cholesterol-lowering drug cholestyramine or a placebo at their fifth visit.

Recruitment of the 3,806 CPPT subjects was completed in July 1976. After randomization into the study, each subject visited his clinic at bimonthly intervals. At these visits, adherence to drug and diet were assessed, the study medication was supplied, general health and potential toxic side effects were monitored, and intervening cardiovascular events were recorded. Counseling in drug and dietary adherence were given at each visit, and medical advice was given when a problem was identified. Trial data were collected and analyzed at the Central Patient Registry and reviewed periodically by a Safety and Data Monitoring Board. Intervention ceased between May and August 1983. A five-year follow-up was initiated in November 1984 to detect possible toxicity in the CPPT participants following ingestion of cholestyramine (or placebo) for 7 to 10 years. Follow-up was completed in October 1989.

Although it was generally agreed that many patients with severe angina pectoris improved symptomatically after coronary artery surgery, there was less consensus concerning, for example, other effects of the procedure, such as its long-term benefit and the criteria for patient selection. In addition, there were fewer data and less agreement on the effects and proper role of this procedure in other clinical circumstances. Both the surgical procedure and the prior diagnostic procedures represented substantial costs in both monetary and manpower terms; moreover, they entailed morbidity and mortality risks.

There existed an urgent need for reliable and quantitative information regarding the effects of coronary artery surgery in patients with ischemic heart disease. To be meaningful, these data had to be set into the perspective of the clinical course of such patients under medical treatment.

This assessment presupposed a meaningful classification of these patients and of the therapeutic interventions as well as evaluations of the effects of surgical and medical regimens in terms of mortality, the quality of life, and objective hemodynamic and other physiological measurements. Only such information could provide sufficient background for determining the suitability of coronary artery surgery for a particular patient.

In 1972, the National Heart and Lung Advisory Council identified these questions as topics of high priority, and the National Heart and Lung Institute established an Ad Hoc Policy Advisory Board on Coronary Artery Surgery to assist it in developing a program of research activities. In its report, the Board noted a 'critical need for objective data on the long- and short-term effects of coronary artery surgery.' Requests for proposals were issued to carry out the recommendations of the Board.

Planning of the trial was conducted between June 1973 and April 1975 and included protocol design, the development of a manual of operations, and a pilot study of the registry. In August 1975, registry patients' entry and randomization began at the 11 clinical centers and coordinating center. Initial projections of patient population numbers were underestimated; therefore, five clinical centers were added to the trial in 1976.

The five clinical subgroups of patients in the randomized studies included: stable angina with normal resting left ventricular function; stable angina with impaired left ventricular function; post-myocardial infarction without angina; congestive heart failure due primarily to ischemic heart disease; and patients previously asymptomatic who were discovered to have serious coronary artery disease. All of the above subgroups must have met specifically outlined clinical and angiographic criteria to be placed in the randomized subset. The other two subsets (as distinguished from subgroups) of the study included those patients who were unsuitable for randomization because surgery was the treatment of choice in the judgment of many physicians and those patients for whom medical management was the treatment of choice. The patients enrolled in both the registry and randomized trial were followed for a 10-year period. This allowed evaluation of the primary endpoints, death and myocardial infarction, and the secondary endpoints, angina, status, and quality of life.

A total of 24,959 patients were entered into the registry; 780 patients were entered into the trial. Recruitment ended in 1979. Intervention ended in June 1983. Follow-up was extended for an additional five years to June 1989. Data analysis continued through May 1995 with grant support.

The correlative evidence linking elevated cholesterol to increased risk of cardiovascular disease is incontrovertible. Animal studies have shown that significant reductions in disease in humans may be forthcoming if blood lipids are reduced from elevated levels. Beginning in the 1960s, some patients had undergone a surgical bypass procedure for hyperlipidemia. Patients were selected for surgery after dietary management had been carried out for three years. The average serum cholesterol concentrations decreased markedly and the decrease was sustained.

This grant-supported clinical trial attempted to determine the effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of the partial ileal bypass in patients who had suffered a myocardial infarction within the previous 5 years and who had serum cholesterol over 220 mg deciliter (200 mg if LDL cholesterol was over l40 mg).

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, non-blind, fixed sample study with a control group and an experimental group of equal size. The experimental group received a partial ileal bypass and diet therapy to reduce serum cholesterol and triglycerides. The control group was given conventional medical therapy exclusive of cholesterol-lowering drugs. The primary endpoint was death due to any cause. Secondary endpoints included death due to atherosclerosis and morbidity from recurrent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cerebrovascular accident. Other secondary endpoints included coronary artery bypass surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, cardiac transplantation, and peripheral vascular surgery.

Beginning in January 1993, long-term morbidity and mortality follow-up are continuing through December 1997 under grant support (R01HL49522). Follow-up includes tracking morbidity and mortality by an annual telephone survey and review of patient records, including death and autopsy results. In addition, mortality and morbidity will be correlated with lipid changes and existing arteriographic results. The long-term course of control patients treated with the AHA Phase II Diet counseling will be assessed and the long-term side effects of partial ileal bypass will be evaluated.",Interventional,"Men and women, ages 30 to 64.

It had been postulated that thrombosis plays a major role in the late stages of coronary artery occlusion. Platelet aggregation is a large component in the formation of arterial thrombi. Theoretically, an agent which prevents the aggregation of platelets would be of value in people with coronary artery disease. Aspirin, in small doses, inhibits platelet aggregation for prolonged periods of time, and therefore might be expected to prevent or retard the occlusion of coronary arteries. This would be reflected in a decrease in the incidence of myocardial infarction and a decrease in mortality due to coronary artery disease.

Several studies had given preliminary evidence that regular administration of aspirin may be of benefit to patients with known coronary artery disease. A National Heart and Lung Institute-sponsored study, the Coronary Drug Project, ran a pilot trial of aspirin and placebo in men with previous myocardial infarctions. Preliminary results from this trial demonstrated its feasibility and led NHLBI to sponsor a more definitive controlled study of the benefit of aspirin in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.

An Institute Planning Committee met four times between October 1974 and April 1975 and developed a protocol, manual of operations, and data collection forms. Recruitment of patients began in June 1975, with the first patient randomized on July 2, 1975. Patients who were randomized had been seen at the AMIS Clinical Center for two initial visits and one baseline visit and were free of any reasons for exclusion, such as the current use of anticoagulants and a history of adverse reactions to aspirin. Patients took acetaminophen at times when they would normally take aspirin.

Follow-up was for a minimum of 3 years, with each patient seen at 4-month intervals and monitored for side effects and various nonfatal events, including cardiovascular problems. The primary endpoint was mortality. Annually, a detailed history was obtained and a complete physical examination performed. The study involved 30 clinical centers, a coordinating center, and a central laboratory.

The study completed patient recruitment in the scheduled one year period. A total of 4,524 post-MI patients were enrolled by the 30 clinical centers. Three-year minimum patient follow-up ended in August 1979.

Eligible volunteer patients were recruited to participate in a double-blind clinical trial within 21 days after the onset of the acute event. One-half of the patients were randomly assigned to a beta-blocking drug (propranolol) and one-half to a placebo. The trial also evaluated the effect of propranolol on incidences of coronary heart disease mortality, sudden cardiac death, and nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary heart disease mortality in persons with documented previous myocardial infarction.","BACKGROUND:

Survivors of a documented myocardial infarction are recognized as having a high risk of dying relative to the general population. Serious arrhythmias, occurring with or without evidence of new infarction, are a common cause of death in this population. Theoretically, an agent which (1) can block the sympathetic nervous activity thought to be involved in precipitating sudden death and (2) has non-neurogenic antiarrhythmic properties would be of value to people with coronary heart disease. Propranolol, like other beta- blocking agents, has these as well as other properties and therefore might be expected to prevent or retard complications of coronary heart disease such as serious arrhythmias. This would be reflected in a decrease in mortality due to coronary heart disease.

A workshop on chronic antiarrhythmic therapy reviewed contemporary experimental data and clinical practice and recommended that a clinical trial be undertaken to clearly show the effects of beta-blocking drugs on mortality. Subsequently, such a trial was approved by the Clinical Applications and Prevention Advisory Committee, by the Cardiology Advisory Committee, and by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council.

The study protocol was reviewed in February 1978 and recommended for approval by the policy-data monitoring board and ad hoc members. The protocol was approved by the Director of NHLBI in March 1978. Recruitment started on June 19, 1978, and ended in October 1980. A total of 3,837 patients were randomized. Units which participated in the trial included 32 clinical centers, an EKG center, a central laboratory, a coordinating center, a 1-hour ambulatory ECG center, a 24-hour ambulatory EKG center, and an EKG tape quality control center.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

A randomized, double-blind design with single experimental and control groups. Patients were recruited while in the hospital for an acute myocardial infarction and were enrolled in the study before discharge. Eligible patients fulfilled the study definition of an acute myocardial infarction. The diagnosis was based either on electrocardiographic records showing evolving QRS segment changes or on ST segment and T wave changes together with enzyme changes and appropriate clinical history. One-half of the patients were placed on therapy using a beta-blocking drug (propranolol). The other half received a placebo. The prescribed maintenance dosage of propranolol was either l80 or 240 mgs/day, depending upon serum drug levels. Intervention duration averaged 25 months.

The study of methods for minimizing the mass of ischemic infarcted myocardium associated with a myocardial infarction was identified as a topic of research priority in the 1973 Report of the Panel Chairman for the Preparation of the National Heart, Blood Vessel, Lung, and Blood Program. In September 1976, the Institute convened a workshop involving 32 investigators active in this field, respondents to past solicitations, experts on the topic of collaborative clinical trials, members of previous review committees, and several members of the Cardiology Advisory Committee. The attendees were enthusiastic about the practicality and timeliness of a collaborative clinical trial in this field. The concept of collaborative clinical trials to protect ischemic myocardium was discussed by the Cardiology Advisory Committee in its meeting of September 22, 1976, and was recommended affirmatively and enthusiastically. This trial was part of the Institute's initiatives and was reviewed and favorably recommended by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council at its December 1976 meeting. The trial consisted of five clinical centers, six central laboratories, a clinical coordinating center, and a data coordinating center.

Two concurrent trials were performed.,"BACKGROUND:

The incidence of patent ductus arteriosus is higher in premature infants than in full-term infants and is highest in premature infants who have respiratory distress syndrome. It is generally agreed that intervention in an asymptomatic infant with a small left-to-right shunt is unnecessary, since the patent ductus almost invariably closes spontaneously and thus does not require surgery. A few infants will demonstrate signs of a large shunt during the course of respiratory distress syndrome. Many of these infants will improve with medical management of congestive heart failure, but others require surgical closure. A third group of babies with respiratory distress have severe progressive pulmonary disease requiring ventilatory support. There was disagreement as to whether elimination of the patent ductus in these infants resulted in decreased mortality. A variety of therapeutic approaches was being used, and there was no convincing evidence of the superiority of one treatment over another.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Trial A was a randomized, double-blind trial in which indomethacin plus usual medical therapy was compared with a placebo plus medical therapy. Where this regimen was unsuccessful, the code was broken, and infants who received indomethacin were treated surgically. Infants who had received placebo in Trial A were entered, if there were no contraindications to indomethacin, into Trial B. In Trial B, infants were randomized to surgery or indomethacin therapy.

Diet modification is one of the strategies in the primary prevention of hypertension. Studies of the association between various factors and blood pressure in different populations have shown the occurrence of specific dietary factors associated with elevated blood pressures. The factors include overweight, alcohol consumption and high sodium intake. Heart rate is also an independent predictor of risk of hypertension. Diet and exercise are amenable to intervention to influence blood pressure with the aim of reducing the risk of developing hypertension.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

In the first phase of the trial participants were randomized to a Monitored (Control) Group or to an Intervention Group receiving individualized intervention to achieve changes in diet and physical activity. The goals of the Intervention Group were: a reduction of at least 10 pounds or 5 percent of body weight for those above desirable weight; a reduction in daily sodium intake to 1800 mg; a modification of alcohol intake to no more than two drinks per day; and an increase in regular, moderate physical activity. The primary endpoint in the first phase of the trial was the comparison of mean blood pressure in the Intervention Group versus the Monitored Group.

Coronary atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death in this country and the developed countries of the world. Although modern coronary care units have resulted in a markedly decreased hospital mortality from acute myocardial infarction, especially in those patients who enter the hospital early, its overall impact is limited since two-thirds of patients who die from coronary disease do not reach the hospital. When the trial was initiated in 1979, new approaches to the medical treatment of coronary disease and its complications were needed with an effort directed towards prevention of its progression and prevention of its complications through medical therapy. This prevention could save significant health care dollars over the long-term especially if the need for aortocoronary bypass graft surgery and the incidence of myocardial infarction could be reduced. Early identification of the patient at risk of developing coronary disease or of those with early coronary artery lesions would allow a greater impact of any successful intervention therapy.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind. The patients in the experimental group were treated with dipyridamole and aspirin for five years. Patients in the control group received a lactose placebo.

The proposal made use of the HDFP hypertensive population who had five years of treatment for their hypertension. Additionally, the group of investigators proposed to determine if dietary treatment would permit patients not previously adequately controlled under the HDFP program to achieve normalization of blood pressure with a combination of dietary modification and drug treatment. The study also proposed to search for predictors (i.e., levels of hormonal agents such as plasma renin activity) of responsiveness to dietary manipulation among the hypertensive population as well as to identify psychological attributes that might be of importance in managing these patients.","BACKGROUND:

The background against which the proposal was made had been developed from the combined information of the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study and the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Study. Data from both these studies clearly established the importance of reducing sodium content by means of diuretic administration as a mainstay of the treatment of elevated blood pressure. The risks of the lifetime of treatment were undefined, but the cost of indefinite treatment of high blood pressure was sufficiently high to stimulate careful examination of alternative modes of management of such patients. The demonstrations by Parijs and others that moderate reduction in sodium intake led to improved management of hypertension and data suggesting that increased potassium intake may enhance this blood pressure lowering effect associated with sodium restriction was cited by the investigators as a basis for the trial. Any additional data regarding modest sodium restriction and potassium ingestion would have impact on utilizing such therapy in preventing hypertension and as adjunctive therapy.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The study was intended to take advantage of the availability of patients at the three centers at the completion of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program Study. These patients were enrolled as 'stepped-care' participants and had been treated with antihypertensive drugs for at least five years.

6. To develop and test methods of ascertaining stroke and other disease endpoints.","BACKGROUND:

Isolated systolic hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or greater with a diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg, is known to be associated with an increase of risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. The HANES I group estimated that isolated systolic hypertension, uncommon under 54 years of age, occurred in 5 percent to 10 percent of adults over 55 years and was less common than systolic-diastolic elevation. Evidence was not readily available that there was effective and safe therapy to correct isolated systolic hypertension. At that time, there was no body of clinical or research data that conclusively proved that such therapy, if available, was beneficial.

Several groups had expressed interest in a clinical trial on systolic hypertension in the elderly. Among these were the House Select Committee on Aging, a Blue-Ribbon Panel on Hypertension in the Elderly, Citizens for the Treatment of High Blood Pressure, panels and experts associated with the National High Blood Pressure Education Program, the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke.

A Policy and Data Monitoring Board was appointed to review the protocols for the pilot studies as they developed and make recommendations to the Director of NHLBI. The Policy and Data Monitoring Board reviewed the accumulated data on April 8, 1983 and recommended to the Institute that a full scale trial be implemented. The recommendation was accepted by the Director, NHLBI and was presented to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council at its meeting in May 1983. A full scale trial was conducted.

Thrombosis plays a major role in the late stages of coronary occlusion. Platelet aggregation is a large component in the formation of arterial thrombi. In pharmacologic studies, aspirin has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation and, therefore, might be expected to prevent coronary occlusion. These effects are apparent in the dose range of l00-l000 mg/day, and may be most evident at l60 milligrams daily. Higher doses seem to be no more effective in either inhibition of platelet agreeability or prolonged bleeding time.

Although an early case-control study by Jick and Miettinen showed a large benefit, most observational studies had shown a cardiovascular benefit of about 20 percent. Conclusive data could only result from a randomized trial with a large sample size.

The nature of essential hypertension as a mass public health problem throughout the United States, and internationally as well, is recognized generally. Prevalence estimates exceed l5 percent in most adult populations. Further, the results of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program (HDFP) demonstrated the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy even at the 90-l05 mmHg level, which comprises 72 percent of the total hypertensive population. The Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommended treatment of mild hypertension by pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic therapy to the lowest diastolic pressure consistent with safety and tolerance. The recommendation was consonant with the goal blood pressure guidelines for those with baseline pressures from 90-99 mmHg. Hence, there appeared to be a growing consensus that reduction of blood pressure to levels as low as 80 mmHg might be desirable for optimal cardiovascular health. The Joint National Committee further recommended that, in young patients with uncomplicated mild hypertension, the benefits from pharmacologic therapy must be weighed against the cost, inconvenience, and possible side effects. There was, therefore, a growing concern over the need for pharmacologic management of hypertension and the public health implications of such a course of action. These recommendations toward intervention in mild hypertension set a firm basis for the primary prevention of hypertension.

The association between obesity and elevated blood pressure was widely recognized. Among hypertensive individuals, numerous studies had shown that short term weight reduction by caloric restriction resulted in a reduction of blood pressure. Results of several reports of long-term follow-up of weight reduction efforts indicated that long-term control of weight at levels compatible with the objectives of the HPT was feasible. A number of investigators had achieved these levels one or more years after treatment despite minimal intervention efforts during the follow-up period.

There was strong circumstantial evidence relating sodium intake to hypertension. Most impressive evidence came from the study of the 'low-salt tribes', subsisting on a very low sodium intake. They failed to develop hypertension, or even gradual rise of blood pressure with age. Many studies published on the effect of lowering sodium intake on blood pressure of hypertensive patients had been positive. In one investigation, blood pressure fell approximately 9 (systolic)/6 (diastolic) mmHg when sodium intake was reduced from approximately l80 to l00 mEq/day. Reduction of sodium intake to a level of 70-l00 mEq/day appeared within the capability of most people and maintenance up to a period of two years had been indicated with minimal follow-up procedures.

The role of potassium intake in the development and treatment of hypertension was less clear. As noted above, primitive cultures studied epidemiologically had low sodium intakes associated with low prevalence and incidence of hypertension but these cultures also consumed higher levels of potassium. It has been suggested that the ratio of sodium to potassium may be the most important determinant of blood pressure. Hygienic intervention to increase potassium intake in free-living populations was the least studied of the procedures used in the HPT. Potassium intakes > l00 mEq could be achieved without the use of dietary supplements if individuals consumed large quantities of fruits and vegetables. This natural intake could also be increased by use of potassium-based baking powder and seasonings.

The study was carried out by four clinical and two resource centers (a Coordinating Center and a Nutrition and Educational Resource Center). It was to be Phase l of a long-term intervention trial to determine whether development of hypertension could be prevented in a population at special risk. The initial phase of the study was directed towards testing the feasibility of the intervention, alternative modes of recruitment, quantification of sodium and potassium intake, trends in blood pressure, and the pre-testing of various study procedures.

Each of the four clinical centers recruited 200 or more eligible 25 to 49 year old individuals (total 841), either identified through any of a number of multiple community sources, or through an index of hypertensive cases. The clinical investigators aided by statistical and data processing support from the Data Coordinating Center and intervention support through a special Nutrition and Education Resources Center, formed the collaborative group to test the working hypothesis. The study protocol was completed in the fall of 1982. Recruitment ended September 30, 1983. The three-year follow-up period ended August 1986. Analysis of the data ended in December 1988.

Since the 1960's, developments in cardiopulmonary resuscitation have resulted in the savings of countless numbers of lives. More recently, the emphasis has been on increasing CPR capability through the development of prehospital emergency care systems and the involvement of the lay public in the provision of CPR. The effectiveness of this technique in the prehospital setting has been demonstrated in several community studies of patients in cardiac arrest where survival rates ranged from 11-17 percent.

Additionally, for patients in ventricular fibrillation, the proportion of patients discharged alive ranged from 14-30 percent in five cities where the outcome of EMS programs has been examined. These successes, however, concealed many failures in which CPR could not reverse death even though correctly applied within established periods between arrest and resuscitation. However, considerable potential existed for improving CPR techniques and for making additional inroads towards the estimated 100,000 deaths each year in the United States that could be reversed through the widespread application of CPR.

A major goal of CPR is to maintain adequate peripheral perfusion (particularly the cerebral and coronary circulation) during cardiac arrest while attempts are being made to restore normal cardiac function. Maneuvers which increase intrathoracic pressure, such as total airway occlusion during chest compression and abdominal compression by binding, have been shown to increase carotid blood flow in the dog.

Sixteen periods of conventional CPR followed by SC-V CPR and return to conventional CPR were studied in 11 cases of in-hospital cardiac arrest at Johns Hopkins University. The findings indicated that simultaneous compression and ventilation at high airway pressures (SC-V CPR) greatly increased carotid flow velocity and radial artery pressure over values achieved with conventional CPR. Maximum benefit was achieved in patients in whom standard or conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation was least effective. The increases in flow index noted with simultaneous compression and ventilation were up to 274 percent of control.

The success of this new method of CPR had been demonstrated during in-hospital clinical trials. The benefits of this method suggested the need to test the technique in the prehospital setting where the vast majority of cardiac arrests occur.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Units of the Miami and Dade County Rescue Squads utilized the technique in a mid-point cross-over design. One of the three shifts at each of the study rescue stations had been thoroughly instructed in the SC-V CPR protocol. A second crew was given an intensive review of conventional CPR methodology. The third shift initially received the conventional CPR review and continued to perform conventional CPR. After six months, the third shift was trained in SC-V CPR and utilized the technique for one year. At the cross-over point, the crew trained in SC-V CPR received the same intensive review of conventional CPR as did the other crew. The conventional CPR crews, in turn, were trained in SC-V CPR. Total sample size was 994 patients, 494 in the treatment group and 500 in the control group.

Angiographic studies in the acute stage of myocardial infarction have shown complete occlusion in 75-85 percent and subtotal lesions in the remaining cases. Evidence for spasm in acutely occluded arteries has been reported. However, the majority of pathological as well as intraoperative examinations have yielded thrombotic material at the site of complete obstruction. Indirect evidence of thrombotic material was provided by successful intracoronary thrombolysis in 80 percent of infarct patients with complete obstruction. There could be causative relationships between spasm, intimal damage and coronary thrombosis. Selective applications of spasmolytic and/or thrombolytic substances into occluded vessels enabled high local concentrations with doses that caused little or no systemic effect. Angiographic verification of the results of this pharmacotherapy would help to clarify the role of spasm and thrombus in the pathogenesis of the acute coronary occlusion.

Reperfusion in man has been achieved by coronary by-pass surgery in the acute stage of infarction. Follow-up angiography revealed significant improvement of left ventricular function. Intracoronary streptokinase infusion resulted in recanalization of acute coronary occlusion in 80 percent of cases within 20-30 minutes of infusion time. Reperfusion achieved by intervention angiography has been associated with improved local wall motion as well as improved left ventricular function. Improvement in left ventricular function depended on the duration of symptoms prior to reperfusion and on the presence or absence of collateral blood flow. Available data suggested that improvement was more likely to occur if reperfusion was achieved within 3-4 hours. However, since the majority of patients reached the hospital after greater than 4 hours of chest pain, study of functional changes following late reperfusion was of great practical significance.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The study was a randomized trial of myocardial reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction by selective intracoronary infusion of nitroglycerin and/or intracoronary infusion of streptokinase. The trial was single-blinded as to the interventional therapy; it was double-blinded as to the drug infused. The primary endpoint was the ejection fraction on the 10th day of intervention. Patients were assigned to one of four treatment arms: an intracoronary infusion of streptokinase; an intracoronary infusion of nitroglycerin; combined infusions of nitroglycerin and streptokinase; a control group receiving conventional therapy without acute catheterization. All patients underwent anticoagulant therapy with intravenous heparin followed by warfarin for three months. Patients were followed for a minimum of two years.

Epidemiologic studies had indicated that complex ventricular premature beats made an independent contribution to risk of sudden death in survivors of a myocardial infarction (MI), and did not appear to be merely a reflection of their association with relatively severe myocardial damage. The potential for reduction in mortality by identification and administration of drugs capable of safely suppressing ventricular arrhythmias was tremendous. In 1982, there was incomplete knowledge regarding which types of ventricular arrhythmias responded to various kinds of drugs. A pilot study of antiarrhythmic agents helped clarify this issue.

Numerous antiarrhythmic agents with differing pharmacologic properties and side effects had been shown to suppress ventricular arrhythmias. It had also been postulated that antiarrhythmics might raise an individual's threshold for experiencing ventricular fibrillation. There had been several published reports of large (at least l00 patients), long-term clinical trials of antiarrhythmic agents in post-MI patients. None of these had yielded statistically significant results using mortality as the response variable. This might have been due to incorrect drug selection, inadequate sample size, inappropriate choice of patients, or the lack of impact of arrhythmia treatment on mortality.

Due to incomplete knowledge as to which drug(s) and combinations of drugs were most effective, it was considered to be premature to undertake a full scale trial in 1981-1982. However, the public health problem was of sufficient magnitude to warrant a pilot study to learn more about the efficacy and safety of various antiarrhythmic drugs singly or in combination.

The protocol planning phase began in October l982. Patient recruitment started in July l983 and ended in the summer of 1985. Each patient was followed for one year.

First and second-generation thrombolytic agents (including streptokinase and rt-PA) have been successfully used to restore myocardial blood flow where thrombus has occluded an infarct-related coronary artery. However, further clinical investigation was necessary to determine the most suitable thrombolytic agent dose and method of administration, the risk of subsequent reocclusion, restenosis, and/or myocardial infarction, the need for additional therapies, and the likelihood of benefit or hemorrhagic complications.

In 1983 the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the TIMI Study Group. The group consisted of 13 clinical centers (later expanded to 24), a Radiographic Core Laboratory, Radionuclide Core Laboratory, and a Data Coordinating Center.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The TIMI trial was conducted in two stages. In Phase I or TIMI I, eligible patients were randomized to receive either 80 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or 1.5 million units of streptokinase intravenously to determine relative safety and efficacy. Following randomization, patients found to have angiographically documented stenosis greater than 50 percent in the infarct-related artery received thrombolytic therapy in a double-blind fashion, full anticoagulation, and conventional care. Patients subsequently underwent repeat catheterization, radionuclide ventriculogram, and pre-discharge, six-week and six-month cardiovascular examination.

TIMI I was stopped in February 1985 because of statistically significant differences in coronary reperfusion rates in the treatment groups; rt-PA was found to be the superior thrombolytic agent. Following TIMI Phase I, the manufacturer of rt-PA changed to a large-scale production method for rt-PA, and the new product was found to have thrombolytic activity and specificity in vitro and in experimental animals comparable to the product manufactured by the old method. However, the TIMI investigators concluded that clinical evaluation would be necessary prior to initiation of TIMI Phase II.

Thus, TIMI Open Label Phase studies were initiated in 1985, with the aim of establishing the safety and efficacy of the 'new' intravenous rt-PA. As in Phase I, the endpoint was lysis of coronary thrombus within 90 minutes of the initiation of treatment in patients with documented total occlusion of the infarct-related coronary artery. Additional goals of the study were to determine reocclusion rates of infarct-related arteries at 18-48 hours, as well as to determine the efficacy of PTCA to maintain perfusion in infarct-related arteries and prevention of recurrent myocardial infarction. The TIMI Open Label Phase studies determined that optimal coronary recanalization and maintenance of reperfusion occurred with 150 mg of 'new' rt-PA infused over six hours. However, subsequent hemorrhagic complications observed with 150 mg rt-PA necessitated a change in the dose of rt-PA to 100 mg.

In TIMI II, patient entry began in April 1986 and ended in June 1988 with enrollment of 3,534 patients. Patients were treated with intravenous rt-PA within four hours of the onset of chest pain thought to be caused by myocardial infarction and randomly assigned to an invasive strategy or a conservative strategy. The primary endpoint was survival free of recurrent myocardial infarction at six weeks and one year of follow-up. There were 1,681 patients assigned to the delayed invasive strategy in which catheterization was performed between 18 and 48 hours after rt-PA therapy. If catheterization showed a greater than 60 percent subtotal stenosis of the infarct-related artery that was considered to be technically approachable, angioplasty was attempted. Angioplasty was performed in 60.5 percent of the 1,500 patients who underwent catheterization in the invasive strategy group. The remaining 39.5 percent or 593 patients did not have angioplasty performed. There were 1,658 patients assigned to a conservative strategy in which cardiac catheterization was reserved for the 587 patients who had spontaneous or exercise-induced myocardial ischemia within 21 days of infarction. A total of 13.5 percent of patients in this arm underwent coronary angioplasty, 7.6 percent underwent bypass surgery, and 1.1 percent underwent both procedures; 77 percent of the patients in the conservative strategy group had no revascularization procedure within 21 days of infarction.

TIMI IIA, a subtrial of 586 patients, investigated whether immediate cardiac catheterization with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, when appropriate, would confer an advantage over the same procedure performed 18 to 48 hours later. All patients were treated with intravenous rt-PA within four hours of the onset of acute myocardial infarction.

Obesity is a problem of significant public health concern both in this and other western countries. One reason is that it is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, most notably hypertension. For example, in the Framingham study it was found that relative body weight, weight change during observation, and skin fold thickness were related to existing blood pressure levels and to the subsequent rate of development of hypertension. Additionally, for previously normotensive individuals, the risk of developing hypertension was proportional to the degree of overweight. Obesity is also a major risk factor for type II diabetes mellitus. On the other hand, some overweight individuals are physically healthy but suffer from the psychosocial consequences of their condition so that losing weight would be desirable for them as well as for individuals more at risk for physical illness.

Like essential hypertension, obesity is not only a chronic condition for many individuals but it is also a heterogeneous condition with many underlying causes and interacting factors. It is generally difficult to treat because it is a chronic problem, success comes slowly, and physicians in practice generally understand the condition rather poorly and do not manage it well. Results from studies of caloric restriction, behavior modification and medication have often been disappointing both to the subjects and their physicians. In practice, dropout rates from exercise programs, as well as various dietary self-help programs have been relatively high.

Similarly, in clinical trials dropout rates have often been quite high. Compounding the problem of weight management has been a rather universal negative bias on the part of physicians to prescribing anorexiant medications. It was previously generally held that these agents were either only effective in the short term or not at all. Additionally, there has always been concern about the potential adverse effects of anorexiants as well as their potential for abuse. Physicians who used appetite suppressants often prescribed them for only four to six weeks which was inappropriate in the management of a chronic condition.

In several relatively short term clinical trials (e.g., 16 weeks), it has been shown that appetite control medications such as fenfluramine and phentermine were more effective than placebo in inducing weight loss. It has been less clear from the trials performed heretofore how effective anorectic medications were when used as an adjunct to behavior modification and diet. This aspect was addressed in the first two years of the clinical trial under consideration here.

A second controversial issue concerned the duration of efficacy of anorexiant agents. Originally it was felt that tolerance developed, hence the recommendations for short courses of treatment. A few long-term double-blind studies using anorexiants have since demonstrated that they exert beneficial effects for up to 24 weeks, as evidenced by weight loss and maintenance of weight loss. This was an important finding given, as noted earlier, the chronicity of the problem of obesity.

The so-called stimulant anorexiants, like phentermine, are believed to act via central catecholamine mechanisms. Side-effects include nervousness, insomnia, increased motor activity and cardiovascular disturbances such as tachycardia and elevation of blood pressure. The latter effects led physicians to feel that their use in obese hypertensive patients was very limited. Fenfluramine, although chemically related to the stimulant anorexiants, appears to act via serotonergic mechanisms. It reportedly causes sedation, occasionally diarrhea and few cardiovascular effects.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Double-blind, fixed sample. After a six-week single-blind placebo controlled diet and behavior modification period, participants entered a parallel-group comparison of fenfluramine plus phentermine versus placebo. In the third and fourth years of the study, patients were randomly assigned to either continuous therapy or intermittent therapy. The intermittent therapy group received the medication for three months from April through June and during the period between Thanksgiving and New Year's day.

Determination of the potential value of thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction was an issue of major importance in 1983. An estimated 1.4 million heart attacks occurred each year, of which over 500,000 were fatal. Reduction of mortality required an effective means to reduce infarct size. Studies indicated that reperfusion represented a potent means of achieving salvage of ischemic myocardium. Pilot clinical studies indicated that reperfusion could be achieved in a substantial percentage of patients by lysis of coronary thrombosis with both intracoronary and intravenous streptokinase administration. Intracoronary thrombolysis was receiving widespread clinical applications but had many limitations. The intracoronary route took 90-120 minutes longer to administer than the intravenous route. Because intracoronary therapy required the availability of a catheterization laboratories and highly skilled invasive cardiologists, this treatment was not available to large numbers of patients who were hospitalized in smaller community hospitals.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized design with two groups and fixed sample size. Control patients received routine coronary care. The treatment group received intravenous streptokinase plus conventional care. This was followed with intravenous heparin and warfarin. The primary endpoint was 14 day mortality.

Because of difficulties with quantitative measurement and with feasibility of follow-up, few controlled studies prior to SCRIP had been completed to determine the impact of risk factor modification directly on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in humans. Suggestive evidence existed from animal studies, especially in primates, that diet and exercise altered atherosclerosis as a result of risk modification. But these animal models did not accurately represent the potential for modifying the coronary atherosclerotic process in humans. Some indirect evidence had been developed in humans by studying arteries more accessible than the coronaries. In the several preliminary studies reported using coronary arteriography to study the impact of risk modification on atherosclerosis, the results had been encouraging but far from definitive. One angiographic follow-up study of vein bypass grafts and severely atherosclerotic coronary arteries reported improvement with lipid lowering therapy. None of these studies had included randomization of patients to systematic, intense, long-term risk reduction versus usual care with prospectively identified coronary artery segments with mild disease.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, fixed-sample. A total of 300 patients were randomized, 155 to usual care (UC) in the community and 145 to special intervention (SI). The SI group received intensive efforts directed at reducing or eliminating risk factors, including lowering LDL-cholesterol and increasing HDL-cholesterol, reducing blood pressure, eliminating cigarette smoking and obesity, increasing exercise, and decreasing stressful life experience. The major endpoint was the rate of coronary artery disease progression as measured by angiography, at baseline and at forty-eight months.

Appropriately increased interest and concern about high blood pressure as a major public health problem coincided with the indication that the risks of hypertension-related morbidity and mortality could be reduced by reduction of blood pressure. Consensus suggestions that individualized approaches be used in treating patients with mild hypertension stimulated further investigations of non-pharmacological methods. Such investigations were also of considerable interest in relation to understanding the physiology of blood pressure control as well as the development of less costly non-drug therapies. Interest was heightened by information suggesting that there might be distinctly harmful side effects related to antihypertensive drug therapy, particularly thiazide diuretics, in some settings. Studies of non-drug therapies included dietary modifications primarily involving weight reduction and sodium restriction with increasing recent concern about other factors such as alcohol intake, dietary fat, calcium, magnesium, and potassium intake.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind. One hundred forty-five subjects were randomized into a low sodium placebo group in which sodium intake was restricted to no more than 80 mEq/day, 142 subjects into a potassium supplementation (96 mEq/day) group whose sodium intake was also restricted to no more than 80 mEq/day.

Secondary aims were to determine the effectiveness of platelet inhibitor therapy in reducing the incidence of coronary events and the severity and incidence of angina.,"BACKGROUND:

By dilating coronary stenoses, PTCA can relieve angina pectoris and improve exercise tolerance and left ventricular function. However, restenosis occurs in 20-30 percent of dilated stenoses within three to six months following PTCA making it necessary to restrict patient activities, resume antianginal medications, repeat PTCA, or perform coronary artery bypass surgery.

Balloon dilatation of the atherosclerotic lesion damages the endothelium, intima, and media of the artery. This may lead to restenosis via platelet deposition, mural thrombus formation, and intimal proliferation by mechanisms that appear similar to those causing aortocoronary vein graft (ACVG) occlusions. It had been demonstrated that dipyridamole plus aspirin therapy suppressed these mechanisms of ACVG occlusion in the animal model, prolonged a shortened platelet survival in patients with coronary artery disease, and reduced ACVG occlusions in patients both early and late after the operation. Thus, a trial of these drugs in patients undergoing PTCA was a logical and necessary step to reduce the major shortcoming of the initially successful PTCA therapy, namely the high rate of restenosis.

These clinical trials were conducted in sequence over a four year period.","BACKGROUND:

The hypothesis that omega-3 fatty acids as well as magnesium and potassium in the diet lowered blood pressure in mild hypertensives needed further documentation, although preliminary and less well controlled studies had suggested such an effect was possible. In a previous study the investigators did not find a hypotensive effect of another polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid. In addition, findings of lower blood pressures in vegetarians and results obtained from a study in which vegetarian diets were fed to normotensives led to the conclusion that dietary factors other then linoleic acid were responsible for the possible hypotensive effect of vegetarian diets. The nutrients which were selected for further study, omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium and potassium, occur in higher amounts in vegetarian diets.

Dietary supplementation with fish oils had only been done in a few studies with inconclusive results. However, the relationship of omega-3 fatty acids to the synthesis of prostacyclins, which are locally active vasodilators and which decrease with the excretion of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane, provide a possible mechanism for an effect of these compounds on blood pressure.

The role of potassium in the control of blood pressure was first suggested from cross-cultural studies in which populations consuming high levels of potassium displayed lower rates of hypertension and a decrease in blood pressure with age. Cohort studies within this country have also shown a relationship between potassium intake or the ratio of potassium and sodium, as measured by urinary excretion and blood pressure. Most constantly it found that blood pressure differences between blacks and whites have been related to differences in potassium excretion.

The results from human experimental studies involving potassium supplementation in normotensives and hypertensives have indicated mixed effects but blood pressure lowering was most consistently observed in subgroups with a family history of hypertension or those with higher blood pressure.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Trial 1: Subjects were randomized to a fish oil treatment group of 6 or 12 grams/day of omega-3 fatty acids or to a placebo group. At the end of 12 and 24 weeks, participants in the three groups were crossed-over to one of the other two treatments for an additional 12 weeks. The primary outcome was clinic blood pressure on 3 days at the end of the treatment period.

Trial 2: Subjects were randomly assigned to one of four treatments and placebo: magnesium supplementation; potassium supplementation; calcium supplementation; all 3 supplements; matching placebos. The trial was double-blinded. Each of the treatments was administered for six months with measurements taken at baseline and at the end. The primary outcome was 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP.

For several decades, clinical trials have addressed the question of whether treatment of hyperlipidemia reduces the risk of cardiovascular events. Substantial evidence supports the idea that cardiovascular benefits are related to the degree of reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and perhaps to the degree of increase in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. In these trials, changes in lipid levels have usually been small and the overall clinical benefits have been limited. The appearance in the 1980s of more effective treatments for hyperlipidemia, new arteriographic methods for assessing atherosclerosis, and new insights into atherogenesis permitted an objective investigation into whether the progression of atherosclerosis was retarded or reversed by lipid-lowering agents.

The clinical trial was supported by a subproject within a program project grant.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. Baseline arteriograms were performed and fasting lipid samples drawn before heparinization. Patients were stratified for age below 45 years, cigarette smoking within the previous month, and lipid patterns including familial hypercholesterolemia and triglyceride levels.

Additionally, the Continuation of the Trial of Antihypertensive Intervention Management (COTAIM) tested the effects of long-term weight reduction, and sodium/potassium changes added to weight reduction, as well as the original drug treatment, on the failure rate of blood pressure control.","BACKGROUND:

The Trial of Antihypertensive Intervention Management was an extension of the NHLBI-supported Dietary Intervention Study of Hypertension (DISH) which concluded in March 1984 and showed that either weight reduction or sodium restriction diets reduced relapse rates of hypertensives who had received long-term drug treatment and then been withdrawn from drugs. TAIM was initiated in April 1984 and continued for four years at three centers and added to DISH the art of evaluating combined drug and dietary treatments. COTAIM was continued at three clinical sites in July 1988. Analysis of COTAIM results continued through November 1994 under grant R01HL40072.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

TAIM patients were randomly assigned to one of three diets and to one of three drug regimens. The dietary interventions consisted of a weight loss program, sodium reduction with increased potassium intake, or no change in diet. The drug regimen consisted of a beta-blocker (atenolol), a thiazide-like diuretic (chlorthalidone), or placebo. The major endpoint was change in diastolic blood pressure after six months of intervention. Individuals who did not reach goal blood pressure after six months received additional drugs. Other endpoints included total risk factor score change, psychological function, and lifestyle change.

COTAIM consisted of two studies with a total of 600 subjects. COTAIM I compared the TAIM weight loss group to a randomly selected half of the usual diet group. The primary endpoint of COTAIM I was the degree of control of blood pressure on initial TAIM therapy between TAIM baseline and the end of COTAIM, a five year period.

The secondary objectives were to evaluate: the effect of long-term antihypertensive therapy on mortality from any cause in elderly people with isolated systolic hypertension; possible adverse effects of chronic use of antihypertensive drug treatment in this population; the effect of therapy on indices of quality-of-life; the natural history of isolated systolic hypertension in the placebo population.,"BACKGROUND:

More than 3 million persons in the United States over the age of 60 have isolated systolic hypertension. They face an excess risk (2-3 fold) of stroke, other cardiovascular disease and death. Population-based data show that the prevalence rises from approximately 8 percent in the age group 60-69 years to approximately 20 percent over the age of 80. Based on available data, an annual stroke rate of 2.0 percent has been estimated in this population. The full-scale clinical trial followed a pilot study conducted from 1980 to 1983. Recruitment in the trial began in March 1985 and was finished in January 1988. Follow-up ended in February 1991. Data analysis continued through October 1996.

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disorder contributing to a large proportion of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the United States.

In addition, the side effects of drug therapy may be significant. DITOH would provide much needed information concerning the effects of various means of weight reduction on blood pressure as possible definitive therapy for hypertension or as an approach which could be combined with reduced drug dosages.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized. After three weeks on a control diet, subjects were randomized to the Protein Sparing Modified Fast Diet which provided 600 calories per day (1.5 grams per kilogram of ideal body weight of high quality protein plus 19 grams of fat) or to a 1200 calorie per day Balanced Deficit Diet. After 16 weeks in the weight-loss phase, subjects entered the maintenance program for 20 weeks. Both diets were supplemented with vitamins, minerals, and fluids. The Protein Sparing Modified Fast Diet was supplemented with 5 grams of salt given as bouillon to equal the salt intake of the Balanced Deficit Diet.

There were a Prevention Trial, a Treatment Trial, and a registry.","BACKGROUND:

Approximately two million Americans suffer from heart failure. Since the prevalence of congestive heart failure is known to increase with age, improvements in the average life expectancy would be expected to increase the magnitude of the problem over the next few decades. While advances in the treatment of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and surgical treatment of congenital and valvular heart disease have prolonged survival, many of these patients ultimately develop heart failure in later life.

The therapy of congestive heart failure has undergone rapid change. Until the early 1970s, the mainstay of therapy for the patient with acute and chronic congestive heart failure was digitalis and diuretics. The use of digitalis in patients with heart failure secondary to ischemic heart disease and in those with severe left ventricular failure of either nonischemic or ischemic origin was, however, controversial.

Controversy over the acute and long-term effects of digitalis led to the introduction of a variety of alternative and supplemental therapeutic approaches for the patient with heart failure. In the mid 1980s, a wide spectrum of vasodilators was available. New, at that time, inotropic agents, also found applications as alternatives or supplements to digitalis administration. Although all of these drugs had been shown to be of some benefit in the management of patients with chronic heart failure, there was inadequate information as to the long-term hemodynamic effects of some of these agents and practically no information regarding their effect on survival.

The recognition that patients with congestive heart failure often have elevated peripheral vascular resistance led to the introduction of vasodilator therapy. Of the vasodilators, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appeared to be the most promising because they had been shown to counteract some of the major adverse hormonal and vasoconstrictor mechanisms, relieve symptoms, diminish cardiac dilatation after myocardial infarction, and improve exercise capacity and ejection fraction.

SOLVD was initiated in 1986 primarily to evaluate the effects of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Two considerations influenced the design of SOLVD: it was possible that drug treatment given to patients who already had manifest congestive heart failure might not be as beneficial as initiating treatment in asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction patients; early treatment of such asymptomatic patients might be less beneficial, as the patient might not have measurable activation of the renin-angiotensin axis.

The Request for Proposals was released in August 1984 with the first awards made in July 1985. A second Request for Proposals for additional clinical centers was released in March 1985.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Both trials were randomized and double-blind. Prior to randomization, all patients received enalapril, and placebo for two weeks to enable early detection of non-compliant patients, those unable to tolerate the drug, and those with early side-effects. After completion of the pre-randomization period, participants were allocated to enalapril or placebo using a permuted block randomization within each of the clinical centers. Follow-up visits were scheduled for two and six weeks after randomization and then at four, eight, and twelve months. Thereafter, clinic visits were scheduled at four-month intervals. Patients were followed for a minimum of two years and a maximum of five years. Primary outcome for each trial was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included cardiovascular mortality, sudden death due to worsening congestive heart failure, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, need for cardiac transplantation, and quality of life. Onset of congestive heart failure was an additional outcome in the Prevention Trial. Seven substudies were conducted among subsets of participants and included: diastolic function; echocardiography; exercise; neurohumoral; quality of life; radionuclide; sudden death. Patient recruitment began in July 1986. Recruitment in the Treatment Trial ended six months ahead of schedule in February 1989, and follow-up ended in February 1991. The Prevention Trial ended recruitment in April 1990 and completed follow-up in July 1991. Data analysis continued through November 1994.

The trial also included a registry which enrolled 6,300 patients to study the influence of a number of patient characteristics on mortality. Eighteen of the clinical centers participated. Data were collected from consecutive patients with ejection fraction less than .45 or with radiologic evidence of congestive heart failure over a twelve month period.

The efficacy of oral anticoagulation therapy in reducing the risk of embolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and rheumatic heart disease was well known. The value of anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation without rheumatic heart disease had not been established. Several studies strongly suggested that although the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation was greatest in the presence of valvular disease, the risk of stroke in the absence of valvular disease was also much greater in patients with atrial fibrillation than those without this arrhythmia. What was lacking was a detailed controlled study assessing the degree of reduction in stroke risk by anticoagulation of fibrillating patients without valvular disease.

The second question asked was whether the added potential morbidity or mortality associated with long-term anticoagulation therapy justified its use in the prophylactic treatment of neurologically asymptomatic patients with atrial fibrillation, even if it did reduce stroke risk. Gastrointestinal, urinary tract, cutaneous and joint hemorrhages were all potential serious complications, as was cerebral hemorrhage, including bleeding into areas of recent cerebral infarction. Interest had again focused on hemorrhagic complications of stroke in anticoagulated patients and among risk factors for hemorrhage were large, recent infarcts. No one suggested that anticoagulation, even if very successful in reducing stroke risk, would eliminate it altogether, and thus hemorrhagic infarction was an important potential problem, as was assessment of risk of primary intracerebral hemorrhage.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized non-blind. Recruitment began in September 1985 and ended in June 1989. The experimental group of 212 patients received long-term, low-dose warfarin. The control group of 208 patients did not receive warfarin but could choose to take aspirin. Average follow-up was 2.2 years. The primary endpoint was non-hemorrhage stroke. At entry and annually, the history was recorded and patients underwent a physical examination focusing on neurologic factors. Every year, beginning at six months, patients were sent a questionnaire on neurologic symptoms, bleeding episodes, and other medical conditions. Study nurses contacted all patients to review their responses. Each patient's referring physician was contacted at three months and nine months during each year of follow-up.

Participating institutions in the multicenter trial were organized into three groups. At Group I institutions, on-site investigators performed all clinical evaluations. In Group II, personnel from the central site hospital, the Massachusetts General Hospital, traveled to the local hospitals to evaluate, randomize, and follow patients. Group III institutions referred patients directly to the Massachusetts General Hospital for all procedures.",Interventional,"Men and women, 18 years of age or older, with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation.",No,All,18 Years,,

There had been no prospective, randomized studies that compared the accuracy of EPS versus HM in guiding long-term drug therapy for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Success had been reported using both techniques. Using a rigorous ECG monitoring protocol in patients, a less than five percent per year incidence of sudden death had been reported. Several investigators reported that the results of electropharmacologic testing were predictive of clinical response. One of the largest studies, by Mason and Winkle, reported that, in 51 patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia who were treated with drugs predicted to be effective based on the results of electropharmacologic testing, ventricular tachycardia did not recur in 68 percent at 18 months of follow-up. In contrast, ventricular tachycardia did not recur in only 11 percent of patients treated with drugs predicted to be ineffective.

Two prior studies had compared, in a non-randomized fashion, the predictive accuracy of EPS and HM in treating patients with ventricular tachycardia/ ventricular fibrillation. A retrospective analysis of 44 patients with ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation who underwent both HM and EPS was performed in which the elimination of ventricular tachycardia on the HM and the suppression of ventricular tachycardia induced during programmed stimulation was the therapeutic goal. The positive and negative predictive value of EPS was found to be 88 percent and 94 percent, respectively. The corresponding values for ECG monitoring were found to be 70 percent and 50 percent, respectively. It was concluded that EPS provided a higher degree of accuracy than HM in predicting the long-term clinical response to drug therapy, over a mean follow-up of 18 months. However, in this study the criterion for judging efficacy by HM was a liberal one and involved only the elimination of ventricular tachycardia.

A second study examined the results of HM in 19 patients with ventricular tachycardia who were treated based on EPS. Among eight patients, in whom inducible ventricular tachycardia was suppressed during electrophysiologic testing, six had no change or worsening of premature ventricular contractions on the HM. These patients had a benign follow-up despite the continued presence of frequent or complex ventricular ectopy. It was concluded that EPS was superior to HM in predicting successful drug therapy.

Existing data suggested that both electrophysiologic testing and Holter monitoring might be effective techniques for determining effective drug therapy for ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. However, there was not enough data available to assess which technique was more effective. A prospective, randomized comparison of the two techniques would be a very significant contribution which could potentially have a major impact on the medical community.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, fixed sample, multicenter trial conducted at 14 institutions. Patients meeting clinical criteria underwent Holter monitoring. Those having an average of 30 premature ventricular contractions per hour underwent EPS. Those having inducible ventricular tachycardia were randomized into an EPS arm or to a Holter exercise treadmill arm of drug testing. Each patient received, in random sequences, up to six antiarrhythmic drugs. When an effective drug was found, patients underwent a predischarge HM and exercise test. Follow-up continued for one year after the last subject had been randomized.

Evidence appears to be fairly conclusive that obesity has adverse effects on health and longevity when the relative body weight is 40 percent above desirable weight based on insurance industry tables of weights. The close association between obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, an excess of certain cancers and other medical problems makes it imperative that interventions be directed to change the lifestyles and behaviors of individuals who are overweight. The Stanford Weight Control Project (SWCP) trial examined the effects of weight loss on cardiovascular disease risk factors.

The Stanford Weight Control Project (SWCP) randomized 155 overweight, sedentary, non-smoking men, aged 30-59 years, to one of three groups. Fifty-one were assigned to weight loss through dieting, 52 to weight loss through exercise, and 52 to a control, non-intervention group. Follow-up continued through July 1989.

Kawasaki Syndrome is an acute febrile illness that occurs predominantly in previously healthy young children. It is of unknown etiology and was first described in Japan in 1967. The illness carries an acute mortality rate of approximately 3 percent. The Centers for Disease Control defines Kawasaki Syndrome as a fever lasting five or more days for which no explanation can be found. Patients also must have at least four of the following symptoms: bilateral conjunctival infection; infected or fissured lips, pharynx, or a 'strawberry tongue'; erythema of the palms or soles, or edema of the hands or feet, or generalized or periungual desquamation; rash; and cervical lymphadenopathy.

Coronary artery aneurysms occur in 15-20 percent of children with the illness. In the past, no treatment had been shown to be effective in preventing this complication. Investigators in Japan began to use IVGG to reduce the aneurysm formation. Preliminary results showing the usefulness of this therapy led to a multicenter trial in Japan in which 400 mg/kg/day of IVGG were given for five days to children also receiving aspirin for the condition. Results of the Japanese trial showed that within 29 days of the onset of the disease, coronary artery dilatation had developed in 42 percent of the aspirin-treated children and in 15 percent of the IVGG and aspirin-treated children.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Phase I was randomized, unblinded and stratified by age, sex, and center. Subjects were randomized to receive either 80 to 120 mg/kg/day of aspirin through day 14 of illness, subsequently reduced to 3 to 5 mg/kg/day as a single daily dose or to 400 mg/kg/day of intravenous gamma globulin for four consecutive days plus aspirin as above. Primary endpoint was formation of aneurysms as demonstrated by echocardiograms. Follow-up was for 7 weeks.

Phase II of the trial began enrollment of 549 patients in May 1986 and ended enrollment in November 1989. Two hundred and seventy six children were randomized to receive 400 mg/kg of intravenous gamma globulin over four consecutive days. Two hundred and seventy-three received a single infusion of 2 g/kg of body weight over 10 hours. Both treatment groups received 100 mg/kg of aspirin per day through day 14 and then 3 to 5 mg/kg per day. The primary outcome variables were the presence or absence of coronary artery abnormalities evident at the two week and seven week follow-up examinations.

Since 1970, children and adolescents with hypertension have been detected with increasing frequency. Many of them were thought to have primary or essential hypertension and it remained unclear how they should be managed. Additionally, since tracking of blood pressure occurred even in early life, it was believed that youngsters with blood pressures persistently in the upper deciles for age were at increased risk for later hypertension. No clinical trials had been performed in this age group to examine the effects of non-pharmacologic or drug therapy in lowering blood pressure. The trial was one of the first attempts to examine the effects of a nutritional intervention on the rate of rise of blood pressure in late childhood and early adolescence.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, partial-blind. After 19,542 fifth to eighth grade students were screened, 210 (105 boys and 105 girls) from the upper 15 percentiles of blood pressure distribution were randomly assigned to one of three groups: low sodium diet (70 mmol sodium intake per day), potassium chloride supplementation (normal diet plus 1 mmol/kg potassium chloride per day), and placebo (normal diet plus placebo capsule).

Dietary sodium reduction has a mild effect on the reduction of hypertension. Weight loss, while achievable in the short-run with diet alone, may also have only mild effects on hypertension and is very difficult to maintain with diet and/or behavior modification. Alteration of patients' lifestyles to decrease excessive alcohol intake is somewhat controversial. Medications, on the other hand, have clear benefits in terms of blood pressure lowering, and in the case of diuretics and beta-blockers, reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, there is concern about their justified use in mild hypertension since each one has side effects, some of which may have long-term implications, such as alteration in serum lipids. Newer classes of drugs--calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha blockers--had not previously been compared long-term with diuretics and beta-blockers.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

TOMHS I enrolled 902 men and women to determine the feasibility of a larger trial. Participants were randomized in a double-blind manner to one of six treatment groups and within two strata. Stratum I was for participants not on antihypertensive drugs and Stratum II for those on antihypertensive drugs at initial screening. There were six treatment arms: placebo, a diuretic (chlorthalidone), a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (acebutolol), an alpha blocker (doxazosin mesylate), a calcium antagonist (amlodipine maleate), and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril maleate). All participants received a lifestyle intervention program that included reduction of sodium chloride and alcohol intake as well as weight reduction and increase in physical activity. All participants were followed for at least 48 months, with an average of 54 months. The primary endpoint was lowering of blood pressure. The treatments were also compared for effects on blood chemistries including lipoproteins, echocardiographic left ventricular mass, ventricular ectopic activity and ST-T changes of ischemia as measured by ambulatory ECG monitoring, side effects, and quality of life.

Regular physical exercise is associated with lower coronary heart disease mortality, favorably affects coronary risk factors, and increases cardiovascular functional capacity. Fewer than one-third of Americans engage in regular physical exercise and only 20 percent of men and 10 percent of women over age 45 do so. This is largely because effective strategies for increasing the exercise habit in a broadly-based segment of Americans have not been developed.

Heart failure due to myocarditis can be a devastating illness. At the same time, immunosuppressive therapy is associated with considerable risks of untoward side effects. Clinicians did not know whether, under what circumstances, or in what form, this hazardous treatment should be used in such critically ill patients. In addition, if immunosuppressive therapy was of benefit, then endomyocardial biopsy in patients suspected of having myocarditis was a justified procedure. The trial also provided information concerning the side effects of immuno-suppressive therapy in such patients.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Patients were randomized into two treatment arms consisting of conventional therapy alone for congestive heart failure or combined with a twenty-four week regimen of immunosuppressive therapy. Immunosuppressive therapy consisted of prednisone with either cyclosporine or azathioprine. The primary outcome measure was a change in the left ventricular ejection fraction at twenty-eight weeks.

The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) revealed an unexpected subgroup finding: an association between diuretic therapy (especially with hydrochlorothiazide) and an increased rate of sudden death in hypertensive men with left ventricular hypertrophy and other ECG abnormalities.

Following one month of withdrawal from all diuretics and repletion with oral potassium and magnesium, the study participants were randomized to two months of treatment with one of six treatment groups: hydrochlorothiazide; hydrochlorothiazide with oral potassium; hydrochlorothiazide with oral potassium and magnesium; hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene; chlorthalidone; or placebo.

Each year over 400,000 people in the United States die suddenly of coronary heart disease. The majority have known coronary heart disease. Of these, the post-myocardial infarction population constitutes a large proportion. About 8 to 15 percent of patients who recover from an acute myocardial infarction die in the subsequent year. Half of these deaths are usually sudden, presumably due to arrhythmia. Advanced age, poor ventricular function, and presence of ventricular arrhythmias can identify post-MI patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death and all-cause mortality.

A number of clinical trials have evaluated whether acute or chronic anti-arrhythmic drug therapy can reduce mortality in post-MI patients. Of these, only the use of acute intravenous and long-term beta-blockers, independently and in combination, had been shown to reduce mortality. However, beta-blockers have many actions in addition to being anti-arrhythmic agents and it is possible that these other effects may have been particularly important in prolonging life.

None of the clinical trials of other antiarrhythmic drugs had shown significant benefits from treatment, and a number had even failed to show a positive trend. It was certainly possible that treatment of ventricular premature depolarizations, in itself, did not lead to a reduction in mortality, or even sudden death. The studies that had been done, however, had not adequately addressed the issue. Most of the studies were small and did not select patients on the basis of frequent ectopic beats. Moreover, appropriate drugs in optimal doses may not have been used, and adverse effects may well have outweighed any potential benefit. Poor compliance, perhaps due to adverse effects, may also have limited the opportunity for a beneficial outcome.

In an effort to address some of these points, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute initiated the Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study in 1982. The objectives were to assess: whether post-MI patients with documented ventricular arrhythmia could be identified and enrolled into a double-blind clinical trial; whether one or more drugs could be found to effectively and safely reduce ventricular premature depolarizations over a one-year period; whether dose-adjustment could be carried out, using ambulatory ECG's; and whether good patient compliance could be maintained. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study, which enrolled 500 patients, evaluated four active drugs (encainide, ethmozine, flecainide, imipramine) against placebo. The study was too small to determine whether any of these drugs had an effect on mortality or major morbidity. The study was completed in July 1986.

The pilot study demonstrated that patient recruitment was feasible, that dose-adjustment could be accomplished, and that good compliance to the protocol could be achieved. Because of the encouraging results of the pilot study, the NHLBI conducted a full-scale trial.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind. Enrollment began in June 1987 when twenty-seven clinical centers began to randomize 4,400 post-myocardial infarction patients to placebo or treatment with encainide, flecainide, or moricizine. Prior to actual randomization, there was an open-label titration period to identify patients who responded to treatment. A total of 1,727 patients who responded were randomized: 1,455 to encainide, flecainide, or placebo, and 272 to moricizine or placebo. In April 1989, encainide and flecainide were discontinued because of increased total mortality and sudden arrhythmic death. CAST continued to compare moricizine to placebo in 1,300 patients for 18 months until August 1991 when the moricizine portion of the trial was stopped early because of excess deaths.

Following endarterectomy, platelets adhere and aggregate on the endarterectomized surface and release platelet-derived growth factor which induces smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation which may result in restenosis. Many patients had been treated with aspirin and dipyridamole, but not in a controlled trial. The Recurrent Carotid Stenosis Study established whether antiplatelet therapy was beneficial in the prevention of recurrent carotid artery stenosis.

High blood pressure affects between 15 and 30 percent of the adult population in the United States, and is a major contributor to some of the leading causes of death including coronary artery and cerebrovascular diseases. A substantial body of evidence from both population and laboratory studies indicates that a number of dietary and lifestyle factors are associated with the chronic and progressive increase in blood pressure with age, commonly observed in populations of industrialized countries. There are also an increasing number of reports of important reductions in blood pressure in persons with hypertension following treatment with a number of different non-pharmacological interventions. These observations have led to interest in the possibility of the primary prevention of hypertension through non-pharmacological intervention on factors related to the development of high blood pressure.

In 1979, the main results of the NHLBI-supported Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program (HDFP), then the largest of the randomized clinical trials of antihypertensive drug treatment, were reported. This trial compared the effects of intensive systematic Stepped-Care drug treatment with Referred-Care in the community. These results confirmed findings of earlier and subsequently reported placebo-controlled trials that effective blood-pressure lowering in hypertensive individuals reduces the occurrence of stroke, congestive heart failure, and other complications of hypertension, and for the first time demonstrated a significant reduction of total mortality. The implications of the findings regarding recommendations for long-term drug treatment for tens of millions of Americans led several groups of investigators to consider alternative approaches to the control of hypertension. To the concerns of these clinicians about drug-related symptoms and economic costs were added additional questions regarding the safety of common antihypertensive agents in some hypertensive subgroups, based on the results of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial and on other evidence.

A number of small to moderate-sized randomized clinical trials of non-pharmacologic intervention in hypertension have been initiated during the past 5 years with NHLBI support. The Hypertension Prevention Trial (HPT) was the largest program studying the effectiveness of intervening in a non-hypertensive population. The HPT was a feasibility study to establish the ability to enroll in sufficient numbers men and women with diastolic blood pressure of 78-89 mm Hg; to determine if dietary intervention alone could achieve sustained weight reduction, and/or a decrease in sodium intake, or an increase in potassium intake along with sodium reduction in these subjects; and to study the effects of the interventions on blood pressure. If feasibility were demonstrated, the plan was to conduct a full-scale trial with incidence of frank hypertension as the outcome measure.

The HPT achieved its feasibility goals regarding recruitment of participants and weight reduction, but not for dietary sodium reduction and potassium increase. Some of the other dietary trials among non-hypertensive subjects have also achieved relatively small sodium changes (20-25 percent); a few have produced much larger changes, but only with short-term follow-up. Other experience has also shown that it is difficult to increase potassium intake by dietary means alone.

The importance of further work in this area has meanwhile been reinforced by conclusions of several expert groups convened by NHLBI. These have included the participants in the 1984 NIH Workshop on Nutrition and Hypertension and the 1984 Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, whose report addressed in some detail non-pharmacologic intervention and primary prevention.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Phase I was a pilot study to test the feasibility of providing and obtaining compliance with selected nutritional-behavioral, non-pharmacologic interventions and to measure the short-term effectiveness of the interventions on reducing or preventing an increase in diastolic blood pressure. Ten clinical centers, and a coordinating center, which included two central laboratories and a nutrient data center, participated. Each clinic tested a subset of the interventions. The lifestyle arm of the trial, which included weight loss, sodium restriction, and stress management, had an open design with untreated controls. The two-stage supplement arm of the trial, which tested magnesium and calcium in Stage I, and fish oil and potassium in Stage II, was double-blinded and placebo-controlled. Three clinics tested only lifestyle interventions, two tested only supplements, and five participated in both arms of the trial. Recruitment began in August 1987 and randomization was completed by October 1988. Endpoint data collection was completed in January 1990. The average follow-up was approximately 18 months.

Phase II had a 2x2 factorial design to test the effectiveness of weight loss and sodium restriction alone and in combination in reducing blood pressure and decreasing the incidence of definite hypertension. Lifestyle interventions were administered through counseling sessions at each center. Blood pressure, weight, body mass index, skin fold thickness, and urine electrolytes were measured at baseline and at six month intervals for a minimum of 36 months. Recruitment began at the end of 1990 and was completed in March 1992. Intervention and follow-up were completed in March 1995. Data analysis continued through June 1998 under U01-HL-37852, the coordinating center.

The main results were presented at the 1995 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions. The Phase II main results paper was published in March 1997.

Cardiovascular follow-up was available for 13,194 women. The median follow-up was 57 months; the mean follow-up was 49 months. During long-term follow-up, 76 percent of the tamoxifen participants were compliant with the study therapy; 83 percent were compliant through 24 months of follow-up. To evaluate the effects of tamoxifen in women with and without pre-existing heart disease, the 13,388 women enrolled at the 131 clinical sites were divided into subgroups of those with and without a self-reported history of clinical coronary heart disease, defined as myocardial infarction or angina prior to randomization. Medical records for subjects with suspected cardiovascular events were collected by the clinical sites and forwarded to the NSABP Operations Center for adjudication by investigators who were blinded to treatment assignment. Primary cardiovascular events included fatal myocardial infarction, Q-wave myocardial infarction, and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.

Sudden cardiac death is believed to account for a substantial proportion of deaths in patients with evidence of cardiovascular disease. The exact proportion of cardiac deaths that are classified as being sudden varies depending on the population, the underlying disease, and the definition of sudden death. Various estimates suggest that about 500,000 sudden cardiac deaths occur annually in the United States alone. The majority of sudden cardiac deaths are thought to be due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) or tachycardia (VT).

The commonest approach to preventing sudden cardiac death has been by the use of drugs that suppress ventricular ectopy. The rational for this approach is based upon an association between the presence or frequency of ventricular arrhythmia and subsequent mortality in several studies. None of the randomized controlled studies of numerous 'classical' antiarrhythmic agents (other than beta-blockers, which have only a modest effect on arrhythmia suppression) have demonstrated a reduction in sudden or non-sudden cardiac mortality. Indeed, in the recent Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), two class Ic anti-arrhythmic agents demonstrated a 2.5 fold increase in the risk of sudden and non-sudden cardiac deaths despite excellent suppression of ventricular arrhythmia.

Given the disappointing results of most pharmacologic approaches to preventing sudden death, many investigators have turned to non-pharmacologic approaches such as surgery (endocardial resection, stellate ganglionectomy) or the implantation of devices that recognize VT or VF and deliver a shock. The greatest interest has been generated by work on the implantable cardiac defibrillator.

The study was reviewed by an ad hoc working group, the Clinical Applications and Prevention Advisory Committee, and several members of the Cardiology Advisory Committee prior to review and approval by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council in September 1991. The Request for Proposals was released in February 1992.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

At approximately 28 clinical sites, patients with ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were screened. Those with ventricular fibrillation or serious ventricular tachycardia were entered into a registry for long-term mortality follow-up using the National Death Index. Patients with the prospect of long-term benefit from an ICD and/or antiarrhythmic drug therapy and without exclusions to an ICD or to amiodarone and without a transient or correctible cause of the index event were entered into the trial.

Patients meeting the criteria were randomized to treatment with an ICD or treatment with antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Allocation was stratified by clinical site and index arrhythmia, either ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Patients assigned to the antiarrhythmic drug therapy and without contraindications to sotalol underwent subrandomization to either empiric amiodarone or sotalol, the latter treatment guided by either ambulatory monitoring or electrophysiologic testing. Patients who, after subrandomization, had low levels (less than 30 beats per hour) of ventricular ectopic beats and no inducible ventricular arrhythmias at electrophysiologic study were not treated with sotalol and instead received empiric amiodarone. The AVID protocol allowed usual clinical practice but restricted interventions to state-of-the art ICD devices and first-line antiarrhythmic agents to amiodarone and sotalol. Patients who could not take amiodarone were not included in the trial. The protocol encouraged the use of concurrent drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and beta-blockers when appropriate, administered before randomization and maintained throughout the study. The primary endpoint was total mortality. Secondary endpoints were cost of health care and quality of life. Nonlethal events such as ICD shock, sustained arrhythmia, or syncope were tabulated.

Patients were followed every three months for assessment of secondary endpoints, to record therapies delivered by the ICD and potential adverse effects of the ICD, and to assess compliance and potential adverse symptoms in patients treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained every six months, and appropriate laboratory and pulmonary tests were performed at six and eighteen months on patients receiving amiodarone. The average follow-up was expected to be 2.6 years. Analysis was done by intention-to-treat. The outcome of primary interest in the subrandomization between sotalol and amiodarone was the time to withdrawal from assigned therapy.

After a review of the data by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, the AVID study was stopped early on April 7, 1997 because of the findings that after one year, patients in the defibrillator group experienced a nearly 38 percent reduction in deaths compared to the group of patients taking an antiarrhythmic drug. The defibrillator group had about a 25 percent reduction in deaths in years two and three.",Interventional,"Men & women with VF, VT with syncope, or VT without syncope, but with ejection fraction less than or equal to .40 & systolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg, chest pain , or near syncope.",No,All,18 Years,75 Years,

Also, to prevent the increase in body weight and associated changes in insulin, glucose, blood pressure, triglycerides, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol during the peri- to postmenopausal period.","BACKGROUND:

Coronary heart disease causes almost as many deaths in women as it does in men, with approximately 90 percent of the deaths in women occurring after the age of 50. There are substantial increases in coronary heart disease risk factors at the time of the menopause, especially increases in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, that may well contribute to the increased risk of coronary heart disease.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

A total of 275 premenopausal women were randomized to a control group and 260 women into a lifestyle intervention group, a cognitive-behavioral program which was designed to reduce total dietary fat to less than 25 percent of calories, saturated fat to less than 7 percent of calories, and cholesterol to less than 100 mg. All women were given a weight loss goal of five to 15 pounds, depending on baseline weight status and asked to reduce calorie intake to 1300 kcal until weight goal was achieved. The intervention included an intensive group program during the first six months and follow-up individual/group sessions from six through 54 months. The primary endpoints of the trial were difference in the change in LDL cholesterol and weight between intervention and assessment-only groups at the end of the trial. The intervention also compared whether the dietary intervention could prevent the increase in low density lipoprotein cholesterol and the weight gain observed at this period of a woman's life; whether dietary intervention affected the age of menopause or the percent of women using hormone therapy or having hysterectomy; and whether the dietary intervention had adverse effects on menopausal symptomatology, endogenous hormones, and bone mineral density.

The Office of Research on Women's Health provided supplemental funds to measure hemostatic factors, including fibrinogen, factor VIIc and antigen, antithrombin III and PAI-1 in plasma samples for all subjects at baseline. The supplement allowed a longitudinal description of changes in hemostatic factors that appeared to occur during the perimenopausal transition and an investigation of whether diet and diet intervention altered the pattern of hemostatic changes observed at menopause.

Beginning in February 1996, the trial was extended for four years through January 2000 to provide for data analysis and an additional follow-up of at least 4.5 years for all participants.

Despite evidence that social support and various aspects of negative affect may influence prognosis after a myocardial infarction, the impact of psychosocial supportive interventions had not been demonstrated. Further, little was known about the impact of psychosocial and/or interventions among women patients. Previous work by Nancy Frasure-Smith and colleagues suggested that a one-year post-myocardial infarction program of monthly telephone monitoring of psychological stress symptoms, coupled with home nursing visits for patients reporting high stress levels, had an impact on one-year cardiac mortality and long-term myocardial infarction recurrences among men. However, methodological difficulties prevented drawing firm conclusions. A trial which corrected for these difficulties was conducted involving 948 post-myocardial infarction patients. However, the project was too small to study enough patients to assess program impact separately for men and women. The trial was supported by Canadian sources. The NHLBI supplemented the study in order to expand the sample size from 948 patients to 1,376 patients to allow gender analysis.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, with a multi-hospital design. At the time of discharge from the hospital following a documented myocardial infarction, patients were randomized to treatment and control groups. The control group received usual care from their physicians. In addition to usual care, treatment patients were phoned monthly and responded to a standardized index of psychological symptoms of stress. Those with high stress levels received home nursing visits to reduce their stress. Patients in both groups took part in three interviews: in the hospital, at three months, and at one year post-discharge. Interviews assessed depression, anxiety, anger, self-perceived stress, social support, medication compliance, and cardiac risk factors. Salivary cortisol, a physiological indicator of stress, was assessed on the evening following each interview. Indicators of residual myocardial infarction, ischemia, and arrhythmias were obtained from hospital charts.

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) initiated the trial in 1991, with joint funding provided by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in fiscal years 1992, 1993, and 1995.","BACKGROUND:

A considerable body of data has associated lower blood pressures with higher levels of dietary calcium. Epidemiologic studies, laboratory evaluations, and clinical trials have also indicated that the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is affected similarly by calcium intake. A meta-analysis of five controlled clinical trials of calcium supplementation in pregnancy suggested a significant reduction in proteinuric pre-eclampsia of 46 percent. Several of the trials, however, suffered from 'pitfalls' in the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, including lack of blinding, uncertain definition of endpoints, and unknown techniques of measurement. Most trials have not assessed the role of dietary nutrients or the possibility that a subgroup with low baseline urinary calcium may benefit most from calcium supplementation. In no trial has the potential for increased risk of kidney stones in the treatment group been examined systematically. Moreover, the daily schedule for administration of calcium, has generally not been reported. There was a great need, therefore, to evaluate the efficacy of calcium supplementation for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in a large multicenter controlled clinical trial. The trial considered the role of dietary nutrients, establish whether treatment is beneficial only for those with low baseline urinary calcium, conduct systematic surveillance for urolithiasis, and employ standardized terminology, techniques of measurement, and diagnostic criteria. The NHLBI provided funding to NICHD for three years by means of an Intraagency Agreement (Y01HC20154).

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind, multicenter. Healthy nulliparous patients were randomly assigned to receive either 2 grams of supplemental calcium daily ((n = 2,295) or placebo (n = 2,294) in a double-blind study. Study tablets were administered beginning from 13 to 21 completed weeks of gestation and continued until the termination of pregnancy. Eligible patients entered a run-in period of 6 to 14 days to exclude highly noncompliant subjects. During the run-in, obstetrical ultrasound was performed if it had not been obtained previously, and blood was drawn for serum calcium and creatinine. Follow-up visits were scheduled every four weeks through the 29th week of gestation, then every two weeks through the 35th week, and weekly thereafter. Blood pressure and urine-protein were obtained at each clinic visit, during labor and delivery, and during the first 24 hours postpartum. Primary endpoints included pregnancy-associated hypertension, pregnancy-associated proteinuria, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, or hypertension. Other endpoints included placental abruption, cerebral hemorrhage or thrombosis, elevated liver enzymes, acute renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

An estimated 30 to 40 percent of elderly persons are treated with blood pressure medications. The efficacy of blood pressure drug therapy in older patients with diastolic or combined diastolic/systolic hypertension is well proven, but such therapy can adversely affect quality of life and biochemical profile. In 1992 when the study started, there was a compelling rationale to identify what proportion of medicated, well-controlled elderly hypertensives could be maintained long-term or greater than 30 months in the normotensive state following withdrawal of blood pressure medications. There was also a need to determine whether nonpharmacologic therapy could significantly increase the proportion with a successful outcome.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized. A total of 585 overweight subjects were assigned in a 2 x 2 factorial design to weight loss, sodium reduction, combined weight loss and sodium reduction, or usual life-style control. The remaining 390 subjects of normal weight were assigned in a 2-armed design to a sodium reduction or an attention control group. The control groups were engaged in a series of non-blood pressure related health encounters designed to control for non-specific effects of groups contacts. Withdrawal of antihypertensive medication was attempted following three months of intervention.

Double-blind, two-period cross-over. All participants were given six weeks of intensive nutritional counseling to lower 24-hour urine sodium output from an estimated 165 mEq/24 hours at baseline to less than 140 mEq/24 hours. Only those participants who excreted less than 140 mEq /24 hours after six weeks of intensive dietary sodium intervention and had greater than 70 percent adherence to study capsules were eligible for randomization.

Life expectancy for Black Americans is about 10 percent less than for whites. The leading cause of excessive mortality in older Blacks is cardiovascular disease which may be largely due to disproportionately high rates of hypertension in older Blacks. Conventional antihypertensive drug therapies are frequently associated with adverse effects on quality-of-life (QL) and low compliance rates, especially in elderly minority populations.

The present study is an extension of a pilot study on a comparable sample of 80 Black elderly. The previous study, which was the first of its kind, yielded results which indicated that both TM and PMR produced moderate reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, with TM producing the most significant improvements in blood pressure and in quality-of-life. Dr. Schneider hypothesized from this and related evidence that TM should prove to be an effective therapeutic adjunct to regular pharmacotherapy for mild hypertension in elderly Blacks, and should prove even more effective in fostering compliance and in improving overall quality-of-life without any of the unpleasant side effects of anti-hypertensive medications.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized. Over an 18-month period, 213 people were screened for inclusion in the study. Of these, 127 with initial diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 109 mm Hg, systolic blood pressure of 189 mm Hg or less, and final baseline blood pressure of 179/104 or less mm Hg were randomized to treatment. Of the 127 participants, 16 did not complete follow-up blood pressure measurements. Thus, 111 subjects completed the study. All subjects were pretested over a four session baseline period on clinic blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure, cardiovascular and emotional reactivity, and quality-of-life measures. Subjects were then randomly assigned, 36 to TM, 37 to PMR, and 38 to lifestyle modification education control and followed monthly with major post-tests at three months and eighteen months on these variables.

A solid foundation of epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory evidence underlies the current dietary recommendations for population-based prevention of coronary heart disease. Average blood cholesterol levels will decline with the consumption of less saturated fat and cholesterol than has been traditional in the United States. It is not clear, however, whether reductions in total fat intake are necessary as well. More research also is needed to define how best to provide a national food supply whose composition will enhance efforts to reduce coronary heart disease risk. Fatty acid investigations are especially critical, because this is an area in which the food industry has greater latitude in reformulating products according to current scientific evidence, dietary recommendations, and customer demand. Stearic acid, for example, may be suitable as a replacement for 'hard' fatty acids because it has relatively little effect on total blood cholesterol levels, but it may be rendered less suitable for this purpose if it accelerates the tendency of blood to clot. Similarly, hydrogenated vegetable oils are used as substitutes for saturated animal fats, but they contain trans-fatty acids that may raise low-density lipoprotein levels as do saturated fatty acids. In general, the mechanisms by which diet influences the eventual development of atherosclerosis through alterations in lipid and lipoprotein levels and metabolism, and through other factors such as hemostasis, still are not fully understood.

Human clinical nutrition studies, when feasible, are among the best research approaches for addressing the links between diet and atherosclerosis. Moreover, because of their great relevance to everyday life, their findings are quickly publicized. Often, however, such studies do not yield consistent or reproducible results. The resulting transmission of mixed messages to the scientific and lay communities seriously undermines both the credibility of nutrition research and the public's confidence in the possibility of obtaining reliable and practical advice on how to modify diet. Oat bran, with its rise and fall in the scientific and popular press as well as in the marketplace, is a good example of this phenomenon.

The lack of consistency among designs of clinical nutrition studies seeking to answer the same scientific question (for example, the influence of dietary fiber on serum cholesterol levels) means that their results cannot be readily compared. Some study designs are flawed, lacking adequate hypotheses and control groups. In addition, compliance in dietary studies is frequently less than ideal. Studies that allow participants to select and prepare their own food, even when adhering to an 'experimental' diet, frequently do not provide reliable results. Only in tightly controlled clinical settings, in which the participants receive all food from the experimental kitchen and are known to consume it, can the influence of poor compliance be minimized.

A further complication is that the actual composition of study diets may not be as intended due to natural variations in food sources and the vagaries of food composition databases. Such discrepancies can be sufficient to alter the results of the study and lead to false conclusions, yet research budgets seldom allow for the high cost of food composition analyses.

The typical small size of clinical nutrition studies has far-reaching effects. Because these studies are expensive and require great commitments of labor and space, it generally is very difficult for a single investigator funded by a traditional research grant to enroll, feed, and study more than 20 to 25 participants at one time. This imposes constraints on duration, design, and statistical power; consequently, many human nutrition studies lack sufficient power to detect biologically meaningful differences between groups or treatments. To avoid outside sources of variability that would further reduce study power, investigators usually make efforts to assemble a 'homogeneous' study population and minimize the number of factors that might impinge on the experimental design; thus, studies are most often conducted in young Caucasian males with average or even low plasma cholesterol levels. Not much is known, therefore, about how response to diet is affected by sex, age, race, co-morbid conditions (such as obesity), lipoprotein phenotype and other factors that would make the results more generalizable to the population at large. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the so-called 'hypo-responder' phenomenon, wherein individuals are presumed to be insensitive to the effects of diet on plasma lipid levels, cannot be elucidated unless individuals with a wide range of response are studied in adequate numbers.

The Arteriosclerosis, Hypertension, and Lipid Metabolism Advisory Committee recommended the development of the initiative at their February 1991 meeting. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council approved the concept at its September 1991 meeting.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The first protocol, conducted in 1993-1994, compared the effects of three diets varying in total fat (37 percent, 30 percent, and 26 percent) and saturated fat (16 percent, 9 percent, and 5 percent) on plasma lipoprotein and thrombogenic activity in 103 normal adults. Subjects consumed the three diets for eight weeks each. Ten meals per week were consumed on-site and all other food was packed for take-home use.

The second protocol, conducted in 1994-1995, examined lipoprotein levels and hemostatic parameters in 86 subjects having low high density lipoprotein levels and/or high triglyceride levels and/or high insulin levels and consuming for seven weeks each one of three diets: a typical American diet, a high monounsaturated fat diet, or a high carbohydrate diet.

DELTA also expended considerable effort in the field of food composition analysis. Menus were analyzed chemically to verify their composition and to ensure that the nutrient content did not differ significantly among field centers and diet periods. Food composition analysis research was conducted at Virginia Polytechnic and State University in consortium with the University of North Carolina.

Multiple mechanisms are involved in the deposition of LDL-C into the arterial wall, and the prevention of such deposition as well as the removal of the LDL-particles. Further, there remain questions regarding what causes an existing plaque that has been stable for a long period of time to become occlusive or ulcerating and what may prevent it from doing so. Prevention and treatment are almost certain to become multifaceted and more complex when using several complementary interventions or preventive measures concomitantly.

Multifactorial prevention and treatment may be particularly useful in people with peripheral arterial disease. PAD as manifested by intermittent claudication affects about 0.5 to 1.0 percent of individuals above age 35, with a twofold predominance in men. There is a strikingly increased incidence with age in both sexes, particularly in those above age 50. Mortality in patients with intermittent claudication has been shown to be six times higher than in other people of similar age and gender. The excess in mortality is primarily due to a ninefold increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths. Those who have asymptomatic but measurable PAD (two to two-and-a-half times as many as have intermittent claudication), have relative risks of about 3 and 4 for total and CVD mortality, respectively. Therefore, interventions that prevent the development or progression of atherosclerotic disease or reduce arterial thrombosis should reduce mortality and morbidity due to myocardial infarction and stroke while favorably affecting the morbidity directly associated with PAD.

The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has included peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in its guidelines as a risk factor in the Classification and Decision for Treatment Algorithm. This means that patients who have PVD and elevated LDL-C and one other risk factor such as male gender, family history, cigarette smoking, or hypertension, should have appropriate dietary intervention followed by drug therapy as needed. Even with the guidelines in place since the end of 1987, a survey of PVD patients referred to a major medical center clinic found that very few patients were on lipid lowering therapy, either diet or drug. The reason for the primary care community not modifying lipids in these high risk patients may be related to lack of studies demonstrating benefit of lipid modification in those who have PVD. It is anticipated that many patients with PAD will require treatment for elevated LDL-C. It is not as clear whether interventions aimed at raising HDL-C will result in a slowing of progression of atherosclerosis in this population.

Platelets have been shown to have a key role in the development of occlusive atherosclerosis and thrombosis related to coronary heart disease. Inhibition of platelet function has been postulated to slow progression of atherosclerosis; specifically, aspirin has been demonstrated to reduce lipoprotein deposition in the arterial wall of nonhuman primates. This deposition is even further reduced by the addition of a lipid lowering regimen to the antiplatelet regimen. It remains unclear whether mini-dose, less intense anticoagulation is the most appropriate antithrombotic therapy in people with PAD who are also receiving lipid modifying agents.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Patients were randomized to a control arm or to one of three treatment arms, including a lipid modification arm, an antioxidant arm, and an antithrombotic arm. Patients in the lipid modification arm were randomized to placebo or treated with nicotinic acid to increase HDL while lowering LDL levels equally with the hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor pravastatin as needed in the intervention and control groups. Patients in the antioxidant arm were assigned to daily doses of 24 mg. of beta-carotene, 800 IU of vitamin E, and 1.0 g of vitamin C or to placebo. Patients in the antithrombotic arm received 2 mg/day of active or placebo warfarin taken daily until the fifth follow-up visit. Patients were followed every six weeks after entry for one year of follow-up. The primary endpoint of the study was the efficacy and safety of HDL-C raising along with effective control of LDL-C levels, antioxidant therapy, antithrombotic therapy, and their combinations. The secondary endpoints were to determine the efficacy of the HDL-C raising arm to achieve an increase in HDL-C in the treatment group while also obtaining equivalent reductions in LDL-C in the treatment and control groups, to assess the dose-response of niacin on HDL-C raising, to determine if the combination of low-dose warfarin plus aspirin versus aspirin alone had the expected impact on the hemostatic system, to determine if combination antioxidant therapy (vitamins E and C and beta carotene) led to changes in biomarkers for antioxidants, and to determine the interaction of the lipid altering strategy with antioxidants for effects on biomarkers for antioxidants. Screening began August 1, 1993, randomization began December 1, 1993 and ended December 31, 1994 with a total of 468 patients enrolled. Support for the trial ended in September 1995. Data analysis continues through March 31, 1999 under contract N01HC35124.

Management strategies are urgently needed for the problem of sudden cardiac death, the most common single, non-accidental cause of death in adults in North America. Many consider that the problem of sudden cardiac death has reached epidemic proportions. Contemporary prophylactic management of sudden cardiac death includes identification of high risk populations, based on underlying structural heart disease, degree of left ventricular dysfunction, and evidence of a ventricular arrhythmia propensity. Populations with the highest sudden death cardiac risk, notably those patients resuscitated from spontaneous episodes of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, have been used as test populations for the development of effective prophylactic approaches. However, in such populations, ethical considerations have precluded the use of untreated control groups. Furthermore, such patients comprise only a small proportion of the total patient population that could benefit from an effective prophylactic strategy. The largest 'at-risk' group are those patients with coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular function who have, but have not yet expressed, a ventricular tachyarrhythmia propensity. The major advantages of a controlled trial of prophylactic therapy in the latter population are evaluation of sudden death prophylaxis in the larger 'at-risk' population and the opportunity to do so with an untreated control group. The 'window of opportunity' for such comparisons has been closed in resuscitated patients for some time and is in danger of closing in the larger population. The total absence of controlled efficacy data for ICD use despite 30,000 implanted units of this expensive technology argues strongly for the timely acquisition of controlled data in the larger population before the therapy is embraced any further.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, non-blind. Patients were randomized during surgery for coronary artery bypass graft to receive ICD or not, and followed and censored at 42 months at 35 centers. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The trial described morbidity of ICD treatment, evaluated the effect of ICD therapy on quality of life, and compared health care costs of ICD treatment to those in the control group. Anti-arrhythmic treatment of unsustained arrhythmia was prohibited; anti-arrhythmic drug use, when indicated, was documented; and aspirin was prescribed unless contraindications existed. Recruitment was extended through December 1995 in order to accrue 900 patients, instead of the original 800 projected. As of February 1996, 900 patients had been recruited. In April 1997, the DSMB recommended that the trial be stopped because there was sufficient evidence to conclude that there was no difference between the treatment and control groups. Follow-up was extended for two years beyond the original termination date.

Also, to determine, in a subset of this population, if lowering serum cholesterol with a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor in older adults reduces all-cause mortality compared to a control group receiving usual care. Conducted in conjunction with the Department of Veterans' Affairs.","BACKGROUND:

An estimated 58 million people in the United States have elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140 mmHg or greater and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 mmHg or greater on initial examination) or are taking antihypertensive medication. Perhaps one-half to two-thirds of these have sustained hypertension.

Despite the known etiologic relationship of hypertension to coronary heart disease, large-scale randomized clinical trials in mild to moderate hypertension have failed to demonstrate conclusively that antihypertensive drug treatment, largely based on thiazide-like diuretics, reduces the occurrence of coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction. The pooled results of nine such trials, using primarily thiazide-like diuretics and involving over 43,000 subjects, suggest a 9 percent benefit, with 95 percent confidence limits consistent with a 19 percent benefit or 1 percent adverse outcome. This observed treatment effect compares with a maximum predicted effect on coronary heart disease of approximately 23 percent for an equivalent blood pressure difference, as derived from epidemiologic data. In contrast, the observed beneficial effect on stroke in these trials, 36 percent, is almost exactly that which would be predicted from epidemiologic data. A more recent overview of 14 trials in participants with all levels of hypertension estimated a somewhat larger benefit of 14 percent. While this may be an over-estimate of benefit, these overviews do not include the strongly positive results of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP), in which diuretic-based treatment reduced stroke incidence by 36 percent and major coronary heart disease events by 27 percent.

In the early 1980s, two new classes of antihypertensive agents, the calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors, were developed and licensed for use in chronic antihypertensive therapy. These agents cost more than older agents such as diuretics and beta-blockers, and evidence was limited that might justify their use despite the increased cost. The 1988 Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommended beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, ACE-inhibitors, and diuretics as equally acceptable first-line therapy. All four classes of drugs have been found to control diastolic blood pressure as single agents in 50 percent or more of patients with mild hypertension.

Of these drug classes, only beta-blockers have been compared directly to diuretics in large-scale, long-term clinical trials in hypertension. Three such trials completed in Europe in 1985-1986 showed approximate equivalence of effects on morbidity and mortality in diuretic- and beta-blocker-based regimens. Pooled analysis of these trials yields a 6 percent lower coronary heart disease mortality from beta-blockers. These data are in contrast to the recent Medical Research Council (MRC) Trial in the Elderly, in which patients treated with a thiazide diuretic had significantly lower rates of coronary heart disease compared to beta-blocker treatment or placebo, both by about 45 percent.

Circulating levels of cholesterol, specifically cholesterol associated with the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) fraction, have been established as a major etiologic factor in coronary heart disease in observational epidemiologic studies, in metabolic, pathologic, and genetic studies in humans and selected animal models, and in randomized clinical trials. The clinical trials that have demonstrated a reduction in coronary heart disease incidence from lowering LDL-cholesterol levels have been conducted primarily in middle-aged men with hypercholesterolemia or established coronary heart disease. Experimental evidence for the efficacy of cholesterol lowering in older men is confined to the analysis of small subgroups of clinical trials and is lacking for women of any age. The paucity of clinical trial data led the National Cholesterol Education Program's Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults in their 1987 Guidelines to allow for considerable physician judgement regarding the elderly.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Patients were recruited through office-based practices and hypertension clinics which were reimbursed by the Clinical Trials Center on a per-patient basis. Six hundred patients were entered into the vanguard or feasibility phase and a total of 42,448 were entered into the full-scale trial. The primary hypothesis of the antihypertensive trial was that the combined incidence of fatal coronary heart disease and nonfatal myocardial infarction would be lower in hypertensive patients randomized to amlodipine (a calcium antagonist), lisinopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor), or doxazosin (an alpha adrenergic blocker) as compared to those randomized to chlorthalidone (a thiazide-like diuretic). Secondary endpoints were total cardiovascular mortality, major morbidity, all-cause mortality, and health-related quality of life.

The primary hypothesis of the cholesterol-lowering trial was that mortality from all causes would be lower in the subset of hypertensive patients with LDL cholesterol levels between 120 and 189 mg/dl (between 100 and 159 mg/dl for those with known coronary heart disease) who were randomized to receive pravastatin (a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor) plus the National Cholesterol Education Program Step I cholesterol-lowering diet than those randomized to receive usual care plus diet. Secondary endpoints were the combined incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease death, major non-cardiovascular heart disease morbidity and mortality, and health-related quality of life.

Recruitment for the feasibility phase began in February 1994. The clinical phase of the feasibility study ended in September 1994.

Maternal and fetal complications are more likely to occur in pregnant women with preexisting hypertension. Alterations in calcium metabolism, the renin angiotensin system, and intracellular free calcium concentration have been identified in this high risk population. The beneficial effects of calcium supplementation on blood pressure and the incidence of superimposed pre-eclampsia may be due to correction of the hormonal and cellular basis for vasoconstriction. The trial sought to prove that oral calcium lowered parathyroid hormone, reduced intracellular free calcium, and decreased vascular endothelin production, resulting in vasodilation and compensatory stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized. Double blind. In this observational study, subjects were assigned to two grams of supplemental elemental calcium or to placebo at 13 to 15 weeks gestation. The trial determined the effect of oral calcium supplementation on: the level of blood pressure; the need for antihypertensive drugs; forearm and peripheral vascular resistance; the incidence of maternal complications, including pre-eclampsia and eclampsia; and plasma levels of vitamin D3, ionized calcium, parathyroid, renin activity, angiotensin II, endothelin, nitrate/nitrite, prostacyclins, and intracellular calcium concentrations in lymphocytes and platelets. These variables were measured prior to randomization and every two months throughout pregnancy and the postpartum. Support ended in July 1999.

The strong relationship between diet and blood pressure and the risk of hypertension has been well recognized. Currently, three specific diet-related factors have been recommended by the Joint National Committee on High Blood Pressure as a first-line approach in preventing and treating hypertension: caloric restriction for weight reduction, reduced consumption of alcohol, and lower sodium intake. Many studies, primarily observational, have shown significant associations between blood pressure and other diet-related factors, including micronutrients such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium; macronutrients such as type and amount of dietary fats, particularly polyunsaturated, and protein; and dietary fiber. However, results from individual, randomized, controlled clinical trials testing the effects of these nutrients on blood pressure have been inconsistent and equivocal. On the other hand, both observational and randomized intervention studies have consistently linked vegetarian dietary patterns to lower blood pressure.

To determine which specific dietary component may account for the blood pressure-lowering effect produced by vegetarian diets, numerous studies have examined individual micronutrients, macronutrients, and fiber. A large majority of cross-cultural and observational studies have shown a significant inverse association of blood pressure with the micronutrients, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, while the evidence linking dietary fiber to lower blood pressure comes primarily from studies on vegetarian and other high fiber diets. However, only a few of numerous clinical trials found that potassium or calcium supplements lower blood pressure. Randomized trials of magnesium supplementation generally have not shown a significant reduction in blood pressure. The few intervention studies of fiber supplements likewise generally have not demonstrated significant lowering of blood pressure. Pooled estimates from meta-analyses of potassium and calcium trials have reported small but significant reductions in systolic (potassium and calcium) and diastolic (potassium) blood pressure. All of these results are compatible with small effects of individual dietary components.

Only a few observational and intervention studies have demonstrated a relationship between the macronutrients, dietary fats or protein, and blood pressure. However, recent data analyses shown significant direct associations with saturated fat and dietary cholesterol, and inverse associations with protein intake.

Thus, an overall summary of the literature suggests that there is strong potential for a number of macronutrients and micronutrients to play an important role in reducing blood pressure. Testing dietary patterns rather than specific nutrients is a promising approach because it is not yet known which nutrients might be most effective in lowering blood pressure and because the effect of individual nutrients may be small. Testing dietary patterns would naturally include several nutrients that cumulatively are likely to lower blood pressure. Furthermore, most intervention studies which have not demonstrated decreases in blood pressure from individual nutrients used supplements rather than foods. Therefore, it may be important to test nutrients as components of foods and dietary patterns and not as isolated or processed nutrients.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

DASH, a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial, compared the effects of three dietary patterns on blood pressure. The study design consisted of a three-week run-in period during which eligible participants were provided a diet that approximated a typical American diet in nutrient content. After run-in, eligible participants were randomized to one of three dietary patterns which lasted for eight weeks: a 'typical' American diet in which the macronutrient and fiber content reflected current United States consumption and was relatively low in calcium, potassium, and magnesium; a diet that was high in fruits and vegetables, and therefore high in potassium, magnesium, and fiber. The macronutrient and calcium content of this diet otherwise resembled that of the typical American diet. The third diet, termed the DASH diet, was high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, and had a favorable macronutrient profile. This diet was low in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol, was moderately high in protein, and had a high content of calcium, potassium, magnesium, and fiber. All three diets had about 3 grams of sodium daily--slightly below the average U.S. consumption-- and all included fresh, frozen, canned, and dried foods. None of the diets was vegetarian or used specialty foods containing fat substitutes. Alcohol and caffeine-containing beverages were limited and monitored. Because it was important that good compliance to the diet be assured, food was provided to the free-living study participants. The primary endpoint was change in diastolic blood pressure from baseline to the end of the study. The study compared the changes in diastolic blood pressure among the three dietary patterns. Screening began in June 1994. Randomization began in September 1994 and was expected to take two years. Support for the trial ended in July 1997.

NHLBI funded an ancillary study of DASH entitled, Folic Acid Dose Response. The purpose of the study was to determine the dose-response relationship between dietary folic acid intake and plasma folate and homocysteine. A total of 133 healthy people aged 60 years or older were enrolled. Participants were assigned to either 0, 100, 400, 1000, or 2000 micrograms of folic acid for 6 weeks. Study participants were newly recruited and were not DASH participants.

The American Indian population, including American Indians and Alaska Natives, totals nearly 1.5 million from over 500 tribes and nearly 300 reservations and Alaska Native villages. Earlier in this century, heart disease was rarely noted in American Indians, but in the past decade, cardiovascular disease has become the leading cause of death in American Indians. Several factors may be responsible for this increase: a decreasing incidence of infectious disease, an increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus, and an increasing incidence of obesity. Previous research on non-Indian populations indicates that obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and that it is associated with increases in other cardiovascular disease risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The high prevalence of obesity among American Indians, coupled with its role as a risk factor for hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes, suggests that a reduction in the average weight of young American Indians would improve their health. Reduction of the prevalence of obesity in American Indians has been designated as a goal for improving the health of this minority population and reducing health disparities in our nation.

The successful 4-1/2 year feasibility study was followed by the full-scale randomized trial involving 1,700 American Indian elementary schoolchildren. Schools were the unit of randomization.

The initiative was developed as a result of consultations with the NHLBI Ad Hoc Committee on Minority Populations, the Conference on Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease in Minority Populations, and the Indian Health Service. The need for the study was reinforced by the preliminary data from the Strong Heart Study confirming the high prevalence of obesity in American Indians. The initiative was approved by the Clinical Applications and Prevention Advisory Committee in February 1992 and given concept clearance by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council in May 1992.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The Feasibility Phase of the trial was completed in 1995. The organizational structure has been established, validation studies to determine an endpoint and formative assessment of the tribe communities was completed. Intervention including classroom curriculum, food service, physical activity family component and for the measurement methods including obesity, physical activity, diet intake, knowledge, attitudes and behavior, and process evaluation were completed.

The full-scale trial started in September 1996. The primary aim was to test the effectivenes of a culturally appropriate school-based intervention that promoted increased physical activity and healthful eating behaviors to prevent obesity in American Indian upper elementary school children. The primary outcome was percent body fat after three years of intervention. The major hypothesis was that intervention would result in an absolute difference of 3 percent body fat between the control and intervention schools. All students enrolled in the second grade in the participating schools during Spring, 1997 participated in the baseline survey. Baseline measurements were performed at the end of second grade so that the intervention could begin at the start of third grade. The intervention lasted for three years. A single cohort of children progressed through third, fourth, and fifth grades. Schools were the unit of randomization. Forty-one schools in four centers were stratified within each field center on median percent body fat (PBF) at the end of second grade using data from the baseline measurement. Schools within a field center were then ranked on median PBF. Once stratified, the coordinating center randomly assigned half the schools within each stratum to intervention (21) and half to control (20).

Blacks in the United States have disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Left ventricular hypertrophy, the primary manifestation of hypertensive heart disease and a major independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality, is twice as prevalent in Blacks with hypertension as in whites. Research has implicated chronic socio-environmental and psychological stress in the etiology of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy in Blacks. The trial seeks to investigate directly the impact of stress reduction programs for treating hypertensive heart disease in Blacks, since conventional antihypertensive drug therapies are less successful than expected. Moreover, these therapies frequently have adverse side effects on quality of life, and have low compliance rates, particularly in minorities.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The first study conducted between 1994 and 1999 used transcendental meditation for stress reduction in hypertensive heart disease. The study was randomized and blind. Subjects were randomized to practice TM for twelve months or to receive health education. The following measurements were obtained: left ventricular mass and function using echocardiography; clinic blood pressure and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; urinary sodium excretion; alcohol consumption, weight, physical activity, cigarette smoking, and previous use of antihypertensive medication; various quality of life measures including physical functioning, psychosocial functioning, subjective symptoms, trait anger and anger-expression, stress impact scale, personal efficacy and health locus of control, social supports, ego development, and social desirability.

The trial was part of the Collaborative Projects on Minority Health, an Institute- initiated program to foster collaborative clinical research that focused on new and improved approaches for diagnosis, management, and prevention of cardiovascular, lung, and blood diseases in minorities. The trial was part of a two-grant collaboration on Nonpharmacologic Treatments for Managing Hypertension in African American Adults. Ernest Johnson (R01HL50516),the Program Coordinator collaborated with Robert Schneider (R01HL51519). The objectives of their studies were complementary and the collaborative arrangements allowed them to determine the effectiveness of different approaches to stress management in comparison with a control group that was comparable at both sites. In addition, the treatment schedules in both studies resulted in identical contact time, length of interventions, expectations regarding treatment effectiveness, and follow-up assessment periods. As a result, a considerable degree of pooling of data for analysis was possible.

Dr. Schneider's study was renewed in FY 1999 to conduct a randomized, single-blind, controlled, community-based trial involving 184 African American subjects with known coronary heart disease. Male and female subjects are enrolled at the on-going field site, Martin Luther King-Drew Medical Center in inner city Los Angeles. After baseline testing, subjects are randomized to either active stress reduction with TM or health education control-both in addition to usual medical care-and posttested after 12 months. The primary outcome is carotid artery atherosclerosis (IMT) measured non-invasively by quantitative B-mode ultrasonography. Secondary measures include traditional CVD risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, smoking, exercise), psychosocial stress, quality of life and cost effectiveness.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind. Randomization was stratified by total anthracycline dose, follow-up time from treatment, and age at time of treatment. All patients received the following baseline tests: Maximal Cardiac Index (MCI) on cycle ergometry; echocardiogram/Doppler determined left ventricular end systolic wall stress (ESWS); gated nuclear angiography (GNA) to determine left ventricular ejection fraction; Holter monitoring for 24 hour ECG monitoring. Patients were randomized to either enalapril or placebo. Follow-up visits were conducted to ensure compliance and screen for side effects. MCI and ESWS were measured twice yearly, while all four tests were repeated at the conclusion of the trial, after four to five years of treatment. The primary outcome variables were the rate of decline in MCI and the rate of increase in ESWS. Secondary outcomes were the change in left ventricular ejection fraction and the incidence of arrhythmias. A second aim of the study was to develop an algorithm to determine indications for enalapril use if the study succeeded in showing a treatment effect.

Respiratory morbidity, particularly chronic lung disease (CLD), remains a major cause of long-term morbidity and mortality for preterm infants. Although surfactant replacement has decreased acute respiratory morbidity and mortality, it has not reduced the incidence of CLD. A number of other approaches, including antenatal thyrotropin releasing hormone in conjunction with corticosteroids, postnatal steroid administration, as well as administration of Vitamin E, diuretics, and bronchodilators, have not resulted in clinically important decreases in CLD. Infants with the most severe CLD go on to develop findings suggestive of pulmonary hypertension with cor pulmonale. There is preliminary evidence in the preterm infant with severe chronic lung disease that low-dose inhaled nitric oxide may significantly attenuate the disease and decrease mortality.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The multi-center, controlled and blinded trial investigates the hypothesis that low-dose inhaled nitric oxide administered to preterm infants between 500 and 1250 grams birth weight who continue to require mechanical ventilation at 10 days of age will increase survival without chronic lung disease (CLD) at 36 weeks post menstrual age. Secondary outcomes are duration of ventilation, oxygen requirement and duration of hospitalization. In addition, that there will be expected improvement in infant respiratory status (ventilatory support, airway resistance and compliance) associated with inhaled nitric oxide treatment. Indicators of inflammation and oxidant stress will be assessed by measurements of specific cytokines and protein modifications in tracheal aspirate and plasma samples, respectively. The safety of this therapy will be evaluated by assessing toxicity as measured by clinical bleeding, including intraventricular hemorrhage as well as the incidence of other morbidities of the preterm infant (necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity and infection) and assessing neurodevelopmental outcome through two years of age.

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal estrogen replacement is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease in women, especially in those with established coronary artery disease. The strength of the apparent effect of estrogen in epidemiologic studies suggests that estrogen plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of vascular health. Animal data suggest that the current practice of adding the low dose progesterone to prevent endometrial hyperplasia may inhibit the beneficial effects of estrogen on coronary arteries. Before committing millions of postmenopausal women to long-term estrogen use for prevention of coronary artery disease, it is mandatory to demonstrate that it does indeed protect against coronary atherosclerosis, to determine the impact of co-treatment with progestin, and to understand the mechanisms through which estrogen may exert it's cardioprotective effects.

The Office of Research on Women's Health provided $500,000 in Fiscal Year 1995 for recruitment of subjects.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded. The minimum diameter of coronary stenotic lesions was measured by angiography before and after three years in a group receiving unopposed estrogen replacement therapy, a group receiving estrogen replacement plus continuous low dose progestin, and a group receiving placebo. The incidence of clinical events was documented in all three groups. Secondary objectives of the trial included examining the effect of chronic and acute estrogen administration on endothelium-dependent coronary vasodilator capacity, plasma lipids and lipoproteins, antioxidant activity, blood pressure, glucose metabolism, and plasma hemostatic factors, as well as on behaviors, physical attributes, and psychosocial parameters.

Also, to study the impact of community educational interventions on use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and EDs, on thrombolytic therapy, and on AMI case fatality.","BACKGROUND:

Since the advent of thrombolytic therapy, early treatment holds particular promise for decreasing mortality from coronary heart disease. Thrombolytic therapy can reduce mortality by 25 percent for patients treated within the first few hours of AMI symptoms, with greater benefit the earlier the treatment. Not everyone who could benefit from receiving thrombolytic therapy receives such therapy. One contributing factor is that many people with symptoms do not seek emergency care in a timely manner. Studies show substantial delay times from AMI symptoms to hospital arrival, with means ranging from 4.6 to 24 hours and medians from 2 to 6.4 hours. EMS transport time is estimated to average 7 to 22 minutes, so a large portion of pre-hospital delay is attributable to patient recognition and action. Several factors have been associated with delay time. Sudden onset pain is associated with shorter delay times, and older age, female gender, African-American race, consultation with others about symptoms, and self-treatment programs are associated with longer delay times. There is a need for educational programs that are effective in decreasing delay times, particularly by focusing on people who are at increased risk of having an AMI and groups more likely to delay seeking treatment.

Community interventions to reduce delay time between AMI symptoms and contact with the medical system have been conducted in Britain, Canada, Sweden, Australia, Germany, King County in Washington, and Jacksonville, Illinois. The interventions have been promising, but the studies suffer from problems that make the reported results difficult to interpret. Almost all the published studies assessed delay time pre-to-post intervention and had no control or comparison group, making the magnitude and significance of impact from the intervention difficult to determine. Most were conducted in countries other than the United States, so applicability to the health-care system in the United States is questionable. Although some examined the effect of a public education program on ambulance and ED utilization, the effects of public education campaigns on use of the EMS or ED remains unanswered.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The study was a multicenter, controlled community trial where the community was the unit of assignment and of analysis. Twenty study communities were pair-matched on demographics and one of each pair was randomly assigned to intervention and one to control. The intervention communities received an 18-month community-based intervention to reduce delay time for symptoms and signs of AMI, focusing on decreasing the delay time associated with patient recognition and action. Several methods were used including: educational interventions based on behavior change theory; patient and provider education; public education and community organization.

A conference on physical activity sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) in August 1991 recommended that one priority area for research should be the development and evaluation of interventions for adoption and maintenance of physical activity including interventions that can be incorporated into primary care practice. The 1992 NHLBI Working Group Report on Primary Prevention of Hypertension identified physical inactivity as a risk factor for hypertension. Intervention research applicable to health-care settings is particularly important in light of national recommendations advising health-care professionals to intervene, including Healthy People 2000, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reports, and the American Heart Association.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, multicenter, demonstration and education study. Men and women primary care patients at three sites in Dallas, Palo Alto, and Memphis were randomized to two patient education intervention groups or to a standard care control group of physician advice. Intervention continued for two years for all participants. The primary outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity. Other outcomes were effects on blood pressure, lipoproteins, and weight; the long-term maintenance of these effects; and the cost-effectiveness of various intervention approaches. Recruitment took 15 months and has been completed with the accrual of 874 subjects.

Approximately 7.5 percent of all acute myocardial infarctions which are diagnosed in an emergency room or in-hospital lead to cardiogenic shock and an in-hospital death rate of 70 to 80 percent, usually within one to two days of diagnosis of cardiogenic shock. The high death rate has not changed in the last two decades. Non-random clinical series and animal studies suggest that rapid revascularization following cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction may substantially improve survival. However, the apparent benefit reported in the non-random clinic studies could have resulted partly from a selection bias towards patients with a better prognosis.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, multicenter, Phase III, controlled clinical trial. Patients with shock due to left ventricular failure complicating myocardial infarction were randomly assigned to emergency revascularization or initial medical stabilization. Revascularization was accomplished by either coronary-artery bypass grafting or angioplasty. A total of 152 patients were randomized to early revascularization and 150 patients to conventional therapy consisting of thrombolytics and a possible late attempt at revascularization. Intraaortic balloon counterpulsation was performed in 86 percent of the patients in both groups. The primary endpoint was mortality from all causes at 30 days. Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality at six months and assessment of the quality of life in survivors after discharge.

All patients with a clinically suspected diagnosis of cardiogenic shock complicating myocardial infarction formed a registry, with limited information collected on in-hospital procedures, medications, length of stay and vital status at discharge.

The study has been extended through June, 2005 for patient follow-up and data analyses. Long-term survival rates (6 to 11 years post-MI) will be estimated and the quality of life of survivors of acute MI complicated by cardiogenic shock will be studied. Extended trial data analyses will be conducted: a) To determine the early echocardiographic parameters which are associated with one year survival in cardiogenic shock patients, and to assess the interaction of these parameters with early revascularization; b) To examine differences in disease course and patient outcome as a function of age, gender, national practice, and changes in serial hemodynamic measurements, as well as to better characterize the related conditions and complications of cardiogenic shock.",Interventional,Men and women with myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock.,No,All,18 Years,75 Years,

More than one-third of patients with coronary disease have ""low"" high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) levels (less than 35 mg/dl; United States 20th percentile) and ""normal"" low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) (less than 145; United States mean), a group for whom current treatment guidelines are not based on clinical trial data. Low HDLc levels are strong, independent predictors of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality risk, equally so for both men and women. This high coronary artery disease risk may be due to an imbalance between delivery of cholesterol into the arterial intima by LDL and its removal by HDL. Also, since HDL serve as antioxidants and cytoprotectants, an important HDL role may be to prevent LDL oxidation and thus limit macrophage-mediated intimal lipid accumulation or to prevent vascular cell toxicity. Recent epidemiologic, experimental, and clinical trial evidence suggests that a 15 mg/dl rise in HDL cholesterol would reduce coronary artery disease incidence and mortality by 30 to 70 percent and that antioxidant vitamins E, C, and beta-carotene might reduce coronary artery disease events and atherogenesis. The potential absolute benefit is much greater in those with existing coronary artery disease. It has also been shown that HDLc rises in response to exercise, smoking cessation, weight reduction, and monounsaturated fats.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, Phase III. Each patient was randomly assigned to a lipid-altering strategy or its placebo and to an antioxidant vitamin strategy or its placebo, in a 2 x 2 factorial design. The four groups were simvastatin-niacin plus an antioxidant vitamin cocktail; simvastatin-niacin plus vitamin placebo; antioxidant vitamins alone plus simvastatin-niacin placebo; or placebos for both strategies. All groups were counseled with respect to diet, exercise, and smoking cessation. The primary endpoint was the average change in proximal obstructive disease during the 2.5 year interval between baseline and the followup study.

Innovative approaches proposed include physiologic or functional measurements such as impaired metabolism, perfusion, or endothelial function as well as assessment of epicardial coronary arteries by angiography. Other objectives include developing safe, accurate, and cost effective diagnostic approaches for evaluating women with suspected ischemic heart disease, and determining the frequency of myocardial ischemia in the absence of significant epicardial coronary stenosis, as well as the frequency of non-ischemic or non-cardiac chest pain. A key aspect of the WISE study is to determine whether evidence of myocardial ischemia occurs in the absence of obstructive coronary disease.","BACKGROUND:

Cardiovascular disease exacts a heavy burden on the health of women. Ischemic heart disease claims the lives of nearly 250,000 women in the United States each year. Recognition of ischemic heart disease in women is a major challenge to the primary care physician. Diagnosis of ischemic heart disease requires recognition of clinical symptoms such as chest pain, or events such as a myocardial infarction, which are evaluated by a physician who will confirm the diagnosis with objective tests. Unfortunately, both symptom recognition and diagnostic tests confuse rather than confirm a diagnosis of myocardial ischemia in women. Chest pain syndromes suspicious for myocardial ischemia are common in women. Noninvasive diagnostic methods which often confirm the diagnosis and assess disease severity in men are less reliable in women. This lack of objective data to support the diagnosis of chronic or acute myocardial ischemia may influence the physician's decision to further evaluate women at risk. With precision in diagnosis, efforts to optimize therapies are hampered.

The detection of epicardial coronary atherosclerosis is a major objective in clinical cardiology. The utility of this approach is well established. However, although the presence of atherosclerosis is sufficient to cause myocardial ischemia, whether significant ischemia or risk of ischemia exists in the absence of angiographic epicardial stenosis, is not known and may be important for women.

Recent progress in understanding the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia provides a more complex causal pathway than the heretofore notion of fixed atherosclerotic obstructions in passive conduits. Diseased arteries which may appear angiographically normal as well as arteries with fixed obstructions can respond to vasomotor influences with a detrimental amount of vasoconstriction. The endothelium generates vasoactive and anticoagulant factors that are important mediators of thrombosis. Cycling hormones may further influence these complex interactions. Methods which do not rely solely on fixed obstruction of epicardial arteries are not only possible but may be useful to recognize early atherosclerosis or, for example, endothelial dysfunction which places the patient at risk for untoward coronary events.

The concept for the study was developed by the Cardiology Advisory Committee in collaboration with staff and was approved by the May 1993 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The Request for Proposals was released in April 1994.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) was a four center study designed to evaluate ischemic heart disease and its pathophysiology in women. WISE testing focused on three areas: 1) optimizing symptom evaluation and diagnostic testing for ischemic heart disease; 2) exploring mechanisms for symptoms and evidence of myocardial ischemia in the absence of epicardial coronary artery disease; 3) evaluating the influence of reproductive hormones on symptoms and diagnostic test response. The WISE core data base included demographic and clinical data, symptom and psychosocial variables, coronary angiography and ventriculography data, blood lipoprotein/homocysteine/lipid peroxidation/genetic/hormone/ phytoestrogen analysis, brachial artery reactivity testing, and resting/ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Site specific complementary methods included physiologic and functional cardiovascular assessments of myocardial perfusion and metabolism, ventriculography, endothelial vascular function and coronary angiography. Women were followed for at least one year to assess clinical events and symptom status. In the Phase I (1996-7), a pilot phase, 256 women were studied. Phase II has completed enrolling 1008 women in the study. The WISE study defined contemporary and comprehensive state-of-the-art diagnostic testing to evaluate women with suspected ischemic heart disease, and explore sex specific ischemic heart disease pathophysiology.

The study has been renewed through April, 2005 to extend patient follow-up for a minimum of five years. Dr. Kelsey (U01HL64829) of the Data Coordinating Center at the University of Pittsburgh will continue the follow-up, develop sex-specific incremental outcome models to evaluate the prognostic value of female reproductive variables, assess cost effectiveness of the WISE testing techniques, and continue data analyses. Dr. Reis (U01HL64914) will study the immunologic basis of coronary disease in women, focusing on the role of inflammation and cytokine production. He will measure several cytokines and cytokine-related proteins and genotypes in approximately 900 stored samples from WISE participants. Dr. Pepine (U01HL64924) will study the renin angiotensin system in coronary microvascular dysfunction, focusing on whether polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin/kallikrein-kinin systems and beta-adrenergic receptors polymorphisms are associated with abnormal coronary microvascular function determined by coronary flow reserve measurements.",Interventional,Women over the age of 18 who have suspected ischemic heart disease.,No,Female,15 Years,,

The mechanisms by which these treatments modified atherosclerosis in women were also explored.","BACKGROUND:

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for over 500,000 deaths each year. Although the onset of coronary artery disease is delayed in women, it is the single most important cause of death in women over the entire life span. Indeed, because more women than men survive to old age, mortality due to coronary artery disease for all ages combined is as great in women as in men. Furthermore, once they present with clinical evidence of coronary artery disease, women have a prognosis as poor as, or even worse, than that for men. In part, this may be due to late recognition of coronary artery disease in women, less intensive treatment of women, or a more adverse risk profile in women who develop coronary artery disease. The report of a recent Working Group on Angiographic Trials of Atherosclerosis Prevention notes that, compared to males, females who develop coronary artery disease, have various different characteristics which may affect the vascular response to lipid-altering interventions. These differences led the report to question whether the mechanisms and clinical benefits of lipid-altering agents may be different in men and women. It further noted that angiographic trials conducted to date have been based primarily upon the cholesterol-lowering treatments of diet or drugs and suggested that other approaches based upon the lipid hypothesis could profitably be tested and should be given the highest priority at this time; specifically recommended were trials of hormone replacement and antioxidant therapy in women.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Subjects were randomized into a 2 x 2 factorial trial of hormone replacement therapy and antioxidant therapy. Women were randomized into four treatment groups: both active hormone replacement and antioxidant; active hormone replacement therapy and antioxidant placebo; active antioxidant therapy and hormone replacement placebo; double placebo plus usual care. Hormone replacement therapy consisted of estrogen plus a progestin (PremPro) for all gynecologically intact women, and unopposed estrogen (Premarin) for women with hysterectomies. Antioxidants consisted of a combination of vitamin E and vitamin C. Angiographic change was a primary endpoint of this trial. The study was double-blind to the extent permitted by the interventions; however, it was fully-blinded with respect to outcome variables. Recruitment ended in August 1999. The mean duration of follow-up was approximately three years.

Atrial fibrillation is an extremely common and increasingly prevalent cardiac arrhythmia, particularly in the elderly, and is an important risk factor for stroke. Management of atrial fibrillation remains controversial, and although antiarrhythmic drugs are widely used for this condition, clinical studies to support their use are meager. Management of atrial fibrillation has at least three components: restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm; heart rate control when maintenance of sinus rhythm or when cardioversion is not attempted or impossible; and anticoagulation. The first component of management uses antiarrhythmic drugs and the second uses a different group of antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation. The third is anticoagulant therapy for patients in whom normal sinus rhythm cannot be maintained or in whom cardioversion is not attempted.

The initiative was developed by staff of the Clinical Trials Branch and the NHLBI Working Group on Atrial Fibrillation which met in Bethesda in April, 1993. The initiative was given concept clearance by the February 1994 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The Request for Proposals was released in May 1994.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

A randomized multicenter trial. The trial enrolled only patients with atrial fibrillation who were at high risk for stroke, that is, over 65 years of age or less than 65 and with one or more other risk factors for stroke such as systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, transient ischemic attack, prior cerebral vascular accident. High risk patients were treated with the anticoagulant warfarin. Cardioversion (electrical or pharmacologic) might have been attempted before randomization, but if it was unsuccessful, the patient was excluded from further consideration for randomization. Normal sinus rhythm must have persisted for one hour or greater after cardioversion to qualify as successful cardioversion. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups which included maintenance of sinus rhythm or heart rate control. Both treatment groups had two steps.

In the maintenance of sinus rhythm group, the choice of drugs was left to the primary treating physician, to be chosen from amiodarone, sotalol, propafenone, flecainide, quinidine, moricizine, disopyramide, procainamide, and combinations of these drugs. Atrioventricular nodal blocking drugs were also administered unless contraindicated. The major substudy for AFFIRM randomized initial drug choice among amiodarone, sotalol, and class I drugs. Prior drugs which were ineffective or poorly tolerated were not repeated. There were various drug exclusions depending on the patient's condition. Patients in the maintenance of sinus rhythm group had multiple cardioversions as needed. If there was treatment failure or intolerance after two or more pharmacologic trials, patients were considered for innovative therapy in Step II. In Step II, two maintenance doses of amiodarone were included, a low dose of 100 to 200 mg/day and a normal dose of 300 to 400 mg/day. Each dose of amiodarone was considered to be a single drug trial, so that patients who received treatment with amiodarone at both dosage levels were considered to have had two drug trials. It was not mandatory that Step II therapies be applied in any individual patient. The following innovative Step II therapies were approved for use in the study: (1) ablation of an atrial focus in patients with type I atrial flutter, if it was clinically documented that the atrial flutter led to atrial fibrillation; (2) atrial pacing alone, with or without documented bradycardia; (3) atrial pacing and antiarrhythmic drugs, with either single site or multiple site atrial pacing; and (4) surgical maze or atrial isolation procedures at selected centers. Catheter-based ablative procedures, such as those attempting to mimic the maze procedure were not approved in this study. Implanted atrial cardioverter defibrillators were also not approved. All therapy was periodically reviewed and subject to modification by the Steering Committee with concurrence by the DSMB and the NHLBI. In the event that sinus rhythm was not maintainable by any treatment, patients crossed over to rate control and anticoagulation.

The heart rate control arm used heart rate as the therapeutic target, rather than dose of medications. Drug dosage was adjusted to achieve target heart rates. During atrial fibrillation, heart rate was assessed both at rest and during activity at each clinic visit. The pharmacologic therapies approved for use in this arm included: beta blockers, verapamil, diltiazem, digoxin, or combinations of these drugs . When Step I pharmacologic therapies failed after two or more drug trials, the treating physician could select an approved Step II innovative therapy. The two innovative therapies approved for use with the heart rate control arm were: (1) atrioventricular node modification by catheter ablation, with or without placement of a pacemaker, with or without continued drugs to slow atrioventricular node conduction, and (2) total atrioventricular junctional ablation and placement of a pacemaker.

The primary endpoint by which the two strategies were compared was total mortality, analyzed by intention-to-treat. Secondary endpoints were composite end points (total mortality, disabling intracranial bleed, stroke, disabling anoxic encephalopathy, cardiac arrest, major noncentral nervous system bleed, cost of therapy, and quality of life. Follow-up was a minimum of two years and an average of 3.5 years.

As medical treatments for coronary heart disease have become more sophisticated, they have also become more costly. Evidence concerning the effects of medical and rehabilitative therapies on post-myocardial infarction patients' quality of life, including return to work and to normal levels of functioning, has been mixed. At the same time. recent data suggest that psychosocial factors, such as social isolation and depression, are important predictors of morbidity and mortality in coronary heart disease patients. These studies suggest that interventions which provide psychological support to myocardial infarction patients may enhance both the psychosocial and physical recovery of these patients. To the extent that supportive interventions can be shown to impact favorably on survival and health-related quality of life in myocardial infarction patients, the human and financial costs associated with coronary heart disease can be reduced. The initiative originated in the Working Group on Psychosocial Interventions which met in June 1992.

The initiative was given concept clearance by the October 1993 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The Request for Proposals was released in September 1994.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Individuals with coronary artery disease are at heightened risk for major cardiovascular events. With current advances, a larger segment of our population is manifesting coronary artery disease at a more advanced age. The majority of these individuals have preserved left ventricular function. Prior studies with converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) therapy in patients with depressed ejection fraction have demonstrated that their long-term administration leads to improved survival and reduced risk of myocardial infarction over and above conventional therapy. There is sufficient rationale and experience to indicate that these benefits will apply to the larger group of individuals with coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular function and therefore have even broader public health implications. A definitive trial is needed to assess the capacity of CEI therapy to prevent mortality and reduce the risk of myocardial infarction in patients with coronary disease and preserved left ventricular function.

The initiative was proposed by the former Clinical Trials Branch staff and given concept clearance at the May 1994 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The Request for Proposals was released in October 1994.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

A multicenter, randomized clinical trial. There are approximately 180 centers in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and Italy. Patients are randomly assigned to treatment groups in which the addition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor trandolapril is compared to standard therapy. The primary endpoint includes a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or the need for coronary revascularization (PTCA or CABG) in coronary artery disease patients with left ventricular ejection fraction of 40 percent or more.

The trial was a logical extension of preceding observational and cross-sectional studies on estrogen replacement therapy. Overall, the studies suggested a 50 percent reduction in risk of coronary heart disease in current estrogen users compared to non-users. In spite of such striking findings, most studies had been prone to a number of biases. One major criticism of observational studies had been that women receiving estrogen were generally healthier and more compliant than non-estrogen users.

There was a very large body of observational data suggesting that the use of estrogen in postmenopausal women reduced coronary heart disease mortality by approximately 45 percent. At the same time, there had been some concern that replacement therapy increased the likelihood of uterine cancer and perhaps breast cancer as well, although it was generally accepted that this risk was probably significantly less than the benefits obtained from the reduction of coronary heart disease mortality.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. After baseline angiograms, patients were randomized to one of three arms: micronized 17-beta estradiol, 1 milligram per day; 17-beta estradiol plus medroxyprogesterone, 5 milligrams per day for twelve days per month; and placebo. Subjects in all three arms received lipid-lowering therapy, low fat/low cholesterol diet, and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, in sufficient dosage to reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels below 130 mg/dl. The primary endpoint was progression/regression of coronary obstructive disease as measured by angiography, including the expert human panel and quantitative computer analysis. The secondary endpoint was carotid media-intima thickness determined by ultrasound. Clinical measures included lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, estradiol and medroxyprogesterone levels, urinary prostanoid metabolites, and insulin/glucose metabolism. Subjects were recruited at three centers with active coronary angiography units. Several core facilities supported the study: a Core Lipid Lab, a Reproductive Endocrine Lab, the Biostatistics Lab (Data Coordinating Center) and the Angiographic Imaging Laboratory.

Controlled and uncontrolled studies suggested that beta-blockade improves ventricular function in congestive heart failure. Several trials suggested that beta-blockers may also reduce mortality. In the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, patients with a history of heart failure had less cardiac and sudden-death mortality than those who did not. Patients with a low ejection fraction in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial who were treated with beta-blockade also had a reduction in mortality. The Metoprolol in Dilated Cardiomyopathy trial randomized patients with dilated cardiomyopathies to treatment with metoprolol or placebo. There was a trend toward reduction in a morbidity and mortality endpoint in patients treated with metoprolol, but this was due entirely to a reduction in the need for cardiac transplantation. Thus, despite a reasonable theoretical basis and suggestive clinical studies, the concept that beta-blockers reduced mortality in congestive heart failure patients was unproved.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind, multicenter. Patients were assigned to standard therapy plus the addition of a beta-blocker (bucindolol) versus a placebo. The primary endpoint was total mortality. A radionuclide ventriculogram was performed within 60 days of randomization. History, physical examination, clinical laboratory studies, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and plasma norepinephrine levels were obtained within 14 days of randomization. Patients were stratified by hospital, congestive heart failure etiology, ejection fraction, and gender, and were assigned to a treatment group by an adaptive balancing scheme (""biased coin"" randomization). Patients were randomized to either placebo plus standard congestive heart failure treatment or to the beta-blocker plus standard congestive heart failure treatment and followed for a minimum of 18 months.

Sinai Medical Center, Miami",OTHER,"To determine if dual chamber rate-modulated pacing (DDDR) in patients with sick sinus syndrome is superior to single chamber pacing (VVIR) with respect to subsequent frequency of adverse clinical events such as stroke, quality of life and function, and cost effectiveness.","BACKGROUND:

Permanent pacing is estimated to cost one billion dollars annually in health care costs in the United States. Initially, pacing was primarily confined to ventricular pacing with limited sensing, programming and pacing capacity. Tremendous growth has occurred in pacing technology, making available dual chamber pacing with sophisticated sensing, pacing, and rate control. These more advanced pacemakers are more costly and complicated to place surgically.

One of the most common indications for pacing is sick sinus syndrome. Initial therapy is usually medical to inhibit the tachyarrhythmias (most commonly paroxysmal atrial fibrillation). However, if symptomatic bradycardia results, then permanent pacing is commonly employed. The appropriate type of pacing in this setting is not clearly defined and is controversial.

The development of atrioventricular pacing was principally aimed at improving cardiac hemodynamics and creating a more physiological heart rate control. Hemodynamic studies have clearly shown the benefit of this approach in many patients, particularly those with decreased left ventricular compliance in whom atrial activity contributes significantly to cardiac output. Lack of synchronization between the upper and lower chambers of the heart caused by pacing the ventricle alone can result in a constellation of symptoms commonly referred to as ""pacemaker syndrome"".

The underlying mechanisms by which dual chamber pacing is purported to improve outcome is straightforward; in patients with normal sinus rhythm, cardiac output is improved by 15 to 30 percent. In addition, a number of retrospective studies that have compared single chamber with atrial-based or dual chamber pacing have suggested that the latter may prevent adverse clinical events such as atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, cerebral vascular accidents, and death. While none of these studies was a randomized trial, the literature is consistent with a concept that dual mode pacing results in improved hemodynamics and a more favorable outcome in patients with sick sinus syndrome. However, the data do not provide definitive answers because of small sample sizes and methodological problems. A major problems with all previous studies is probable selection bias favoring implantation of dual chamber devices in younger, healthier patients.

Several small studies have compared functional status and other quality of life measures between single and dual chamber pacing modes and have suggested better quality of life outcomes for the dual chamber mode. Again, these conclusions are severly hampered by the sample sizes, the lack of random assignment or adequate statistical adjustment to control for confounding, use of outdated and/or invalid measures, and potential response bias due to awareness of mode assignment.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

A multicenter, randomized clinical trial. All patients received a dual chamber pacemaker capable of either single or dual chamber rate modulated pacing. Patients were then randomized to either the single chamber mode or the dual chamber mode. Patients with prior stroke were pre-stratified. Clinical and electrocardiographic data were collected during a 1.5 to 4.5 year follow-up. The primary endpoint was either: first occurrence of stroke, or; total (all-cause) mortality. Secondary endpoints included health status, cost-effectiveness, cardiovascular mortality, composite of any of the three major adverse effects expected in sick sinus syndrome patients (total mortality alone or first stroke or congestive heart failure hospitalization), first occurrence of atrial fibrillation, heart failure score, pacemaker syndrome, health status in women and in the elderly, and outcome of patients with risk factors for pacemaker syndrome. Enrollment was completed in October, 1999 with a total of 2,010 patients.

Quality of life and economic issues were assessed in patients at entry and annually for three years. Questionnaire-based measures of health status and quality of life were compared in the two pacing groups for the entire population and subgroups defined by age and gender. The economic substudy measured the comparative costs, both direct and indirect medical and nonmedical, of the two pacing modes in an attempt to determine the most cost-effective approach to pacemaker treatment of sick sinus syndrome.

The report of the Task Force on Respiratory Diseases identified a clinical syndrome of acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI) and estimated that approximately 60,000 Americans die of ARI yearly. ARI was not precisely defined; indeed, the Task Force realized that pathologists do not recognize ARI. The Task Force pointed out that no diagnostic tests for early detection of ARI exist, that the incidence and prevalence of the disease are not known, and that existing therapy is supportive and nonspecific (diuretics, corticosteroids, etc.). The pathogenesis of the syndrome, the mechanism of interstitial edema, the defenses of the lung against agents causing ARI, and the ultrastructural pathology and natural history of the disease were virtually unknown. The Task Force indicated a need for Respiratory Care Centers with highly trained personnel that could reduce mortality from ARI.

This clinical trial grew out of the Task Force report. Nine participating centers defined ARI in clinical and physiological terms and agreed to a prospective randomized study for 3 years to compare treatment of severe ARI by conventional means with treatment by extracorporeal membrane oxygenators.

Animal studies have shown that ECMO's can provide one to two weeks' support for the lungs without serious blood damage, in contrast to bubble oxygenators, which allow complete pulmonary bypass for approximately 6 hours, after which severe blood damage occurs at the direct blood-gas interface. If patients with hypoxia secondary to acute reversible lung injury can be supported with ECMO's until the lung lesion heals, improvement in survival rates and avoidance of the hazards of conventional therapy may result. The trial, now completed, was conducted at nine clinical centers in the United States.

Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome is one of the leading causes of disability and death in the newborn. In the United States, approximately 10 percent of all infants are premature, and each year about 50,000 cases of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome occur.

Extensive studies in animal models on respiratory distress syndrome have demonstrated that antenatal administration of synthetic (dexamethasone) and natural (cortisol) corticosteroids accelerates lung maturation and significantly diminishes the occurrence of RDS. Although a variety of conditions in newborn infants have been treated with steroids over the past 20 years without adverse effects, investigations have been needed on the short-term effects of corticosteroids administered antenatally on neonate and mother and on the long-term effects on the infant.

The Planning Phase of this trial was completed in March 1977, with formulation of a common protocol and manual of operations. Patient screening and enrollment began in August 1977 and ended on March 1, 1980. Follow-up ended in August 1983 and data analysis was completed October 31, 1983.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a major health problem in the United States. In 1975, it was the sixth leading cause of death. The economic impact of the disease in 1972 amounted to $803 million in the direct costs of disability treatment, $3.05 billion in disability costs, and $645 million in lost earnings due to premature death.

Motivated in part by the significant toll of this disease, a conference on the Scientific Basis of Respiratory Therapy, co-sponsored by the American Thoracic Society and the Division of Lung Diseases, examined the current status of the use of oxygen therapy in chronic lung disease. The proceedings of the conference, published in the American Review of Respiratory Disease (Vol. 110, No. 6, December 1974), included a recommendation for clinical studies that would provide a critical assessment of the role of nocturnal oxygen therapy in the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Low-flow oxygen, administered continuously, was known to benefit some patients with chronic hypoxic lung disease. However, low-flow oxygen administration for long periods of time is cumbersome, confining, and expensive. If nocturnal oxygen administration could be unequivocally demonstrated to be efficacious, then the advantages of convenience and cost would have a favorable impact on treatment of patients, and a rationale could be developed for testing this therapy in a larger group of patients.

The Planning Phase of the trial was initiated in September 1976. Patient recruitment began in May 1977. The Recruitment Phase lasted 24 months. The 203 patients in the trial were assigned randomly to nocturnal oxygen therapy (home) or continuous low-flow oxygen therapy.

The evaluation compared the use of IPPB with use of a powered nebulizer.,"BACKGROUND:

Intermittent positive pressure breathing may be a useful adjunct therapy for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is, however, quite expensive; moreover, in 1976 its treatment efficacy had not been determined. Although the effectiveness of IPPB had been previously studied, the influence of long-term treatment was not known for the following reasons: The individuals studied had been too few and were not randomly assigned to treatment groups, the patient groups were not homogeneous and their clinical and functional status were not well-documented, and precise descriptions of the manner in which IPPB was administered were not recorded.

Based on these facts, a conference on the Scientific Basis of Respiratory Therapy, co-sponsored by the American Thoracic Society and the Division of Lung Diseases, issued a recommendation to develop a controlled clinical study of IPPB. Contracts were awarded to five clinical centers and a data center in November 1976. Planning of the trial ended in November 1977. Recruitment began in April 1978 for the 985 individuals who took part in this trial and ended in October 1980.

In 1983, reliable data on the incidence of pulmonary embolism in the adult population and in groups identified at risk were not available because the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic procedures had not been determined. Estimates suggested there were about half a million episodes of pulmonary embolism in hospitalized patients each year in the United States. Deaths attributable to pulmonary embolism would be expected in about one third of these patients if left untreated.

The clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was subject to a high frequency of false positives and false negatives. The most definitive diagnostic procedure was pulmonary angiography, an invasive, expensive procedure which was not without risk. It required specialized equipment and highly trained personnel both for performance and for interpretation. Therefore, it was used to diagnose pulmonary embolism only in the major medical centers. Another technique utilized as a method to diagnose pulmonary embolism involved a combination of perfusion and ventilation scanning; this method was only minimally invasive. A normal perfusion scan was thought to be of considerable value because it essentially excluded the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. In selected patient populations, abnormal perfusion scans combined with normal ventilation scans were of substantial help in diagnosis.

Although there had been no acceptable validation of the use of perfusion scans in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, thousands of patients had been evaluated for pulmonary embolism based on perfusion scanning often using methods of imaging now considered to be inadequate. In the early 1980s, clinical practice interpreted a negative perfusion scan as overwhelming evidence against the presence of pulmonary emboli. This interpretation had not been adequately tested either in a prospective study or by long-term follow-up of patients to determine clinical outcome. With regards to positive perfusion scans, there were data to suggest that as many as two-thirds of positive perfusion scans could not subsequently be confirmed by pulmonary angiography. Prospective studies in which timely angiograms using selective injections and improved imaging techniques were needed to evaluate the usefulness of positive perfusion scans.

Phase I was initiated in September 1983. Protocols developed during Phase I underwent independent assessment review in April 1984 and were reviewed and approved by the May 1984 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. Recruitment and intervention started in January 1985 and ended in September 1986. Follow-up was completed on September 30, 1987.

In the early 1980s, there was increasing concern that the dramatic improvement in the survival of immature infants had been accompanied by an increase in incidence of pulmonary complications, some seriously crippling and eventually fatal. Both barotrauma and oxygen toxicity had been considered in the pathogenesis of these disorders; circulatory disorders as a result of failure of closure of the ductus arteriosus or fluid overload had also been proposed as contributory factors. Reports of successful application of the principles of high frequency ventilation (HFV) in the treatment of infants with RDS and particularly those with severe interstitial emphysema raised hopes that this technique might prevent barotrauma to the lungs and stimulated physicians and engineers to develop new equipment useful in ventilating small infants.

Although HFV had not been evaluated either with regard to efficacy or safety and although results of fundamental studies had not provided a good understanding of how gas exchange occurred during HFV, there was considerable interest in introducing this type of ventilatory support in neonatal intensive care. HFV involves the use of small tidal volumes, delivered at respiratory frequencies ranging from 1 to 40 Hz with the aid of, for example, a piston pump or a high speed jet of gas. Compared to conventional mechanical ventilation, HFV offers several potential advantages, including reduced intrapulmonary pressure swings and fluctuation in alveolar pressures and the possibility of lowered levels of inspired oxygen. At that time, theories suggested that HFV produced a pattern of flow that enhanced gas mixing and 'homogenized' the distribution of ventilation. Experimental observations in adult animals (cats, dogs and rabbits) or healthy newborn lambs had shown HFV to be effective in promoting gas exchange without apparent adverse effects. Studies in prematurely delivered subhuman primates, that develop RDS and subsequently bronchopulmonary dysplasia indistinguishable from that of human infants, supported the notion the HFV could provide better oxygenation and lower C02 levels than conventional mechanical ventilation at similar mean airway pressure. The HIFI trial provided badly needed controlled data on the safety and efficacy of HFV in premature infants.

Phase I, the Planning Phase, was initiated in August 1984. Recruitment and intervention began in February 1986 and ended in March 1987. Follow-up studies continued thru September 1988.

The principal endpoint was the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia defined as: the need for supplemental oxygen on the 28th postnatal day and for more than 21 of the first 28 days after birth; and abnormal chest radiographic findings that persisted until the 28th day of age. Other endpoints included the need for ventilatory support, the incidence of crossover from one form of ventilatory support to the other, and mortality rate before the 28th day of postnatal age.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, affecting nearly 10 million persons. COPD accounts for 60,000 deaths yearly and ranks as the fourth leading cause of death. If current trends continue, it may become the nation's fourth or even third leading cause of death by the year 2000.

Epidemiological studies consistently indicated that smoking was the over-whelming risk factor for accelerated decline in pulmonary function and subsequent development of COPD. Furthermore, evidence from several studies indicated that the rate of decline in pulmonary function approached a more normal rate of decline upon cessation of cigarette smoking.

Another presumed risk factor for accelerated decline in pulmonary function was the presence of hyperreactive airways, although it was not clear whether the mere presence of hyperreactive airways contributed to the accelerated decline, or whether the decline resulted from the reaction of the airways to various irritants over a long period of time. It is possible that if the hyperreactive airway was kept non-reactive by pharmacological means over a period of years, the expected abnormal decline might be lessened. This effect might be enhanced by the cessation of cigarette smoking.

Although the evidence was strong that smoking and hyperreactive airways were risk factors for COPD, it had not been demonstrated whether removal of risk factors at a stage when mild dysfunction had already occurred would effectively modify the course of COPD.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Lung Health Study I

Randomized and controlled. Cigarette smokers with evidence of airways obstruction underwent baseline testing that included spirometric responses to isoproterenol and methacholine and were then randomly assigned to one of three groups: a no intervention or usual care group; a group receiving a smoking cessation program and bronchodilator therapy; a group receiving a smoking cessation program and a placebo bronchodilator. The placebo/bronchodilator therapy was double-blind. The smoking intervention consisted of an intensive 12-session smoking cessation program combining behavior modification and use of nicotine gum, with a continuing five-year maintenance program to minimize relapse. The bronchodilator consisted of ipratropium bromide prescribed three times daily, two puffs per time, from a metered-dose inhaler. All groups were followed yearly for five years. The primary endpoint was the rate of change of FEV1. Respiratory morbidity was a secondary endpoint. Recruitment began in November 1986 and was completed in January 1989. The clinical phase of the trial ended in April 1994. The study continues under contract N01-HR-46002 through September, 2004 for data analysis and dissemination of research results.

Lung Health Study III

Beginning in fiscal year 1998, all surviving participants of LHS I are invited to participate in the long-term followup. The study will determine, using an intent-to-treat analysis, whether the LHS I smoking intervention significantly reduces the incidence of clinically important respiratory and cardiovascular disease over a 12- to 15-year period following study enrollment. The study will also estimate the magnitude of the effects of FEV1 and FVC on the risks of cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and mortality, after controlling for smoking history. Studies will be conducted on the role of other factors such as gender, airways reactivity, weight gain, and co-morbidities in determining the rate of decline in pulmonary function and the risks of cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and mortality. A determination will also be made as to whether the improvement in lung function and reduction in respiratory symptoms associated with smoking cessation result in improved health-related quality of life (HRQL) and less depression over an extended follow-up period.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and a major cause of morbidity, is a spectrum of chronic lung diseases including clinical diagnoses of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and combinations of both. Varying degrees of bronchoreactivity occur over the entire spectrum. Asthma and COPD have many features in common. Distinction is usually dependent on clinical features and clinical course. The diagnosis of asthma will not exclude a patient from the designation of COPD for this study, although criteria for exclusion include recent (within six months) use of inhaled or oral steroid with the intent of excluding most of those who are clearly predominantly bronchospastic. The morbid anatomy of COPD is well described and includes many features of acute and chronic inflammation. There is well supported evidence in the literature that this inflammatory process may be an important pathogenetic mechanism in the development of emphysema. On this basis, the rationale for the use of corticosteroids is well justified. There are various published studies suggesting that inhaled steroids reduce bronchial lavage markers of inflammation, variously influence short-term bronchial hyperreactivity, improve lung function acutely or short-term, and slow rate of decline in lung function. Most studies have asked for improvement rather than stability. However, despite the studies which do not support these contentions and the lack of long-term information, inhaled steroids in COPD are becoming widely used in clinical practice. It was the intent of this clinical trial to assess the long-term efficacy of this treatment before such therapy became an accepted community practice, making it impractical or impossible to conduct a clinical trial.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Subjects were recruited from the Lung Health Study I and randomized to 1200 micrograms of triamcinolone in daily divided doses or to placebo. Pulmonary function was evaluated every six months. Bronchial activity was tested at baseline, at nine months, and at three-and-a-half years using a methacholine inhalation challenge. Mean duration of follow-up was 40 months. The primary outcome measure was the rate of decline in pulmonary function as assessed by the post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) value. Other outcome measures included death, respiratory symptoms, quality of life, side-effects and toxicity, adherence, bronchial hyperreactivity, atopic status, and smoking status. Recruitment was initiated in November 1994 and ended November 28, 1995 to allow 3.5 to 4.5 years of follow-up through April, 1999.

The investigators initiated a dose monitor (puff counter) protocol at nine of the centers among the fair to satisfactory compliers (4 to 9 puffs versus the ideal of 12 puffs per day) to test whether a memory aid would enhance inhaler compliance. Consenting participants were randomized to Group 1 who could see the display on the puff counter for 12 months or to Group 2 who had no counter for three months, a counter that recorded but did not display for three months, and a counter with display for six months.

Respiratory distress syndrome affects more than 40,000 infants annually in the United States. The overall mortality rate exceeds 20 percent and in infants weighing less than 1500 grams at birth, RDS is responsible for or contributes to the 30-70 percent mortality, depending on birthweight. The present customary treatment of RDS with intermittent mandatory ventilation is accompanied by sequelae such as extra-alveolar air leaks, intraventricular hemorrhage, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in approximately 50 percent of survivors.

The respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn is a disorder in which the pulmonary surfactant is deficient. It has not been possible to completely replace natural components of surfactant with synthetic components and achieve a mixture which functions physiologically like pulmonary surfactant. Therefore, studies of replacement therapy for surfactant deficiency have used complete natural surfactants or derivatives of natural surfactant which contain the defined components of surfactant. The surfactant used in the clinical trial was derived from human amniotic fluid.

Two basic different strategies for surfactant treatment of respiratory distress syndrome have emerged: prophylactic, or preventilatory, treatment at or shortly after birth versus rescue treatment after the initiation of mechanical ventilation in instances of clinically confirmed respiratory distress syndrome. Although treatment at birth has the theoretic advantage of delivering surfactant more uniformly to the airways before mechanical ventilation, it has the disadvantages of delaying physiologic stabilization after birth and resulting in unnecessary treatment, at considerable cost, of 20 percent to 40 percent of infants born at or less than 30 weeks of gestation. Rescue therapy permits early physiologic stabilization and confirmation of respiratory distress syndrome, but with the theoretic disadvantages of early lung injury from mechanical ventilation in the surfactant-deficient lung and less uniform surfactant distribution. Previous comparative trials have been biased by incomplete study enrollment and inclusion of infants in preventilation treatment groups without evidence of surfactant deficiency or immaturity. In addition, outcomes have varied in placebo-treated infants.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, placebo-controlled. Singleton infants were assigned to receive a placebo (air), prophylactic surfactant treatment given intratracheally, or rescue surfactant treatment. Multiple birth infants received either prophylactic or rescue treatment. Of 282 potentially eligible infants, 246 received treatments at birth and 200 had respiratory distress syndrome and received the full course of surfactant therapy. Preterm infants randomly assigned to receive prophylactic treatment received surfactant soon after birth; those assigned to receive rescue surfactant had instillation at a mean age of 220 minutes if the lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio was _ 2.0 and no phosphatidylglycerol was detected in either amniotic fluid or initial airway aspirate, oxygen requirements were a fraction of inspired oxygen of > 0.5 and mean airway pressure was _ 7 cm H20 from 2 to 12 hours after birth. Up to four treatment doses were permitted within 48 hours; approximately 60 percent of surfactant-treated infants required two or more doses. Endpoints included the mortality rate at 28 days of age, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 28 days after birth and at 38 weeks to adjust for differences in gestational age, the incidence of pulmonary air leaks, and the severity of respiratory distress syndrome as assessed by requirement for supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation.

The potential importance of respiratory, chiefly inspiratory-muscle, fatigue had only recently been appreciated. If inspiratory muscles fail, so does ventilation and tissue respiration. There are theoretical reasons to postulate inspiratory muscle failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and suggestions that it may occur in an acute form with exacerbations and in a chronic form during 'stability'. There are two therapeutic strategies available for prevention and treatment of inspiratory muscle fatigue: training inspiratory muscles to increase their efficiency and resting fatigued muscles. The former should work if chronic fatigue is not present, and the latter should allow recovery from chronic fatigue, so the two approaches are not necessarily mutually exclusive. This proposal was originally designed to test the efficacy of each of these therapies alone and also in combination; however, given the experience of a pretrial period, these goals were scaled back. Since there was reason to believe that VMR may be more effective than IMT, the trial focused on VMR and sham VMR only.

Ventilatory muscle rest was applied using a negative pressure ventilation suit sealed at the patient's hips, arms, and neck. A widebore tube connected to a fitting in the suit above the grid on the chest and upper abdomen transmitted negative pressure to the chest wall from the pump, thereby inflating the lungs.

The evidence for chronic inspiratory muscle fatigue in patients with COLD resided largely in several relatively poorly controlled studies indicating that nocturnal artificial ventilation, which presumably rested the inspiratory muscles, produced improvement in daytime function and blood gases. The trial produced some badly needed data on both the occurrence of inspiratory muscle fatigue in COLD patients and its treatment with VMR.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, blinded. A total of 1,231 patients in the metropolitan Montreal area were screened. Of these, 348 were recruited to enter a four week stabilization period, and 184 were subsequently randomized to either active or sham negative pressure ventilation (NPV). A five day in-hospital period was used to train patients in ventilator use and obtain baseline measures of exercise capacity, lung function, respiratory symptoms, and quality of life. Randomization was stratified on the basis of whether or not the patient had been receiving oxygen at home. Home ventilation treatment took place during a following 12-week period. Respirator use was recorded from patient logs and from concealed meters installed in the units. Patients received four home visits by physiotherapists during the 12-week period and returned to the hospital for follow-up at four and twelve weeks post-discharge for reassessment. The principal outcome measure was the distance in meters walked in six minutes. Secondary outcome measures were cycle exercise endurance time, severity of dyspnea, quality of life, arterial blood gas tensions, and respiratory muscle strength.",Interventional,No eligibility criteria,No,All,30 Years,75 Years,

It is estimated that at least 150,000 individuals die each year of adult respiratory distress syndrome. Treatment remains largely supportive. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) conducted the Extracorporeal Support for Respiratory Insufficiency (ECMO, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) trial from June 1974 through 1978. In ECMO, 90 patients were randomized to either extracorporeal membrane oxygenation plus conventional therapy or to conventional therapy. Survival rates were less than ten percent in both groups. The failure of the trial to demonstrate the superiority of ECMO over conventional ventilatory support resulted in the virtual elimination of the use of ECMO in clinical medicine.

In the earlier NHLBI trial, ECMO was implemented with a veno-arterial shunt which approximated 90 percent of the baseline cardiac output. Ventilation of the lungs was continued with reduced function of inspiration oxygen. Thus, the lungs were deprived of the principle source of blood supply while continuously exposed to potentially injurious ventilatory pressures and gas composition. The present patient trial used a new form of therapy developed by Dr. Gattinoni and co-workers in Milan, Italy with the collaboration of Dr. Kolobow at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda. The authors reported a 77 percent survival rate for the new therapy. In Step 1 of the new therapy, the patient was initially ventilated with pressure-controlled, inverted ratio ventilation. If the patient did not improve, Step 2 using extracorporeal perfusion was performed with a veno-venous shunt in contrast to a veno-arterial shunt. The veno-venous shunt preserved pulmonary blood flow whereas the veno-arterial shunt diminished it. Step 3 was reserved for those patients who did not meet the therapeutic criteria of Step 2. They underwent low frequency positive-pressure ventilation and extracorporeal CO2 removal involving veno-venous bypass via the internal jugular and femoral or bilateral saphenous veins.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, fixed sample. Patients were stratified by age (under and over 40 years) and by the presence or absence of trauma. Patients were assigned to conventional positive pressure ventilation therapy or to a three-step therapeutic program employing pressure-controlled-inverted-ratio-ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, and low-frequency positive pressure ventilation-extracorporeal CO2 removal. The main outcome measure was survival at 30 days after randomization. Secondary outcome measures included hospital costs, physiologic data, length of hospital stay, and blood product consumption. Follow-up took place during the year after hospital discharge.",Interventional,"Men and women with acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a major health problem and a leading cause for hospital admission in the United States. A severe form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that is accompanied by weight loss is commonly referred to as pulmonary cachexia. Studies in the 1960s demonstrated associations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients between weight loss, low FEV1, and early mortality. This observation was strengthened by a retrospective analysis of the Intermittent Positive Pressure Breathing Trial data that suggested malnutrition was an independent predictor of outcome in men with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The underlying basis relating malnutrition to adverse outcome in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was unknown, although there was a large body of information indicating that pulmonary cachexia was associated with respiratory muscle atrophy, myofibrillar substrate depletion, and impaired skeletal and respiratory muscle function. The primary question was whether the nutrition-related functional deficits observed in underweight patients could be reversed.

The first three years of the study supported a pilot project of oral nutrition therapy in malnourished chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

All subjects underwent intubation during the initial testing interval and subsequently underwent dietary counseling and oral nutritional supplement during a two-month stabilization phase. Subjects who demonstrated adequate weight gain defined as achievement of more than 90 percent of ideal body weight or who were unable to tolerate intubation were eliminated from further investigation. Eligible subjects were randomized to either ENS or to dietary counseling only. Subjects randomized to ENS received enteral supplementation with Osmolite delivered by continuous infusion pump. Feedings were continuous or nocturnal for sixteen weeks in order to deliver a caloric intake of 1.7 times the resting energy value. Following the intervention phase, all subjects were maintained on dietary counseling on a monthly basis with oral nutritional supplements. Outcome variables were measured before and after the stabilization phase, at eight and sixteen weeks during the intervention phase, and at eight and sixteen weeks during the post-intervention phase. The primary outcome variable was muscle strength and its effect on exercise performance, dyspnea, and quality of life. Secondary outcome variables included morbidity and mortality. The grant was extended through November 1995 for data analysis.

The adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a multifactorial disorder most commonly occurring secondary to sepsis syndrome. Sepsis syndrome occurs in 250,000 to 500,000 patients per year with approximately one-third of these developing ARDS and other organ failures. Extensive studies utilizing the sheep endotoxin model of ARDS as well as data from human pilot studies suggest that cyclooxygenase inhibitors (in particular, ibuprofen) would be useful in the prevention and reversal of many of the pathophysiological abnormalities related to sepsis. Animal studies where ibuprofen treatment was given prior to endotoxin have shown that ibuprofen can improve oxygenation, pulmonary and systematic hemodynamics, airway mechanics, and lung lymph flow. Importantly, animal studies have also shown that established airways mechanics abnormalities and pulmonary hypertension can be reversed by ibuprofen even when given 2.5 hours post endotoxin. Pilot studies of ibuprofen in patients with sepsis syndrome showed that temperature and heart rate were significantly reduced and suggested that airway mechanics and oxygenation were improved, shock was reversed and that these changes were temporally related to prostaglandin levels in urine and plasma.

The results of a multicenter study of ibuprofen intervention in patients with sepsis performed at two medical centers between 1985 and 1987 demonstrated the antipyretic effect of ibuprofen with accompanying decrease in heart rate, reduction in peak airway pressure during the time of intervention, and evidence from urine assays of reduced in vivo production of PGI2 and TxA2. Results suggested that PGI2 production correlated inversely with systemic vascular resistance and the TxA2 production correlated directly with pPA and airway resistance. Several parameters indicating beneficial effects tended toward improvement during ibuprofen intervention.

The study was conducted at seven North American clinical centers and included a coordinating center and a prostaglandin laboratory. Planning and completion of the protocol and manual of operation took place for the first six months of the study. Patient accession extended for three and a half years. Data analysis was conducted in the last year.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter. Recruitment at the seven clinical sites began in October 1989 and ended in March 1995. A total of 224 patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to ibuprofen given intravenously every six hours for a total of eight doses and 231 patients were randomized to placebo. The major endpoint was mortality rate at 30 days after randomization. Before the first dose of the study drug, a baseline medical history was taken and a physical examination was performed to document the presumed cause, site, and time of onset of the sepsis syndrome. Blood was obtained for culture from at least two sites. Infection was classified as occurring in the lungs, peritoneum, or urinary tract or at another site or an unknown site. Chest radiographs were obtained at entry and scored by the chest radiologist to indicate the presence and severity of pulmonary edema.

Baseline characteristics of the ibuprofen and placebo groups were balanced with respect to a variety of measures that correlate with mortality and morbidity. The mean interval that elapsed from the time the patient met the entry criteria to the administration of the study drug was 10.7 +/- 0.6 hours in the ibuprofen group and 11.3 +/- 0.6 hours in the placebo group. The predominant site of infection was the lung. In each group, infections associated with positive blood cultures were considered to have been treated with appropriate antibiotics in 96 percent of cases. Rates of organ dysfunction (organ failure) were similar in the two groups at the time of randomization, except that renal dysfunction was significantly more common in the placebo group.

The method of calculating the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score was modified so that the score represented a point in time -- that is, it was calculated from the baseline data rather than from the worst values obtained during the first 24 hours of care in the intensive care unit. Data obtained at entry and every four hours thereafter for the first 44 hours and then at 72, 96, and 120 hours included the patient's temperature, mean systemic blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, urinary output (as an hourly average), arterial-blood gas measurements and requirements for antipyretic agents. Values for mean blood pressure were calculated with the following formula: (0.33 x systolic pressure) + (0.67 x diastolic pressure. When a pulmonary artery catheter was present, the cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure, and central venous pressure were measured at baseline and 20 hours later. Blood lactate was measured, and the delivery and consumption of oxygen calculated, at baseline and 20 hours. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and 20, 44, 72, and 120 hours after study entry for the measurement of hemoglobin, the total leukocyte count, the platelet count, bilirubin, serum aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and electrolytes.

Asthma is a serious chronic condition, affecting approximately 14 million Americans. People with asthma experience well over 100 million days of restricted activity annually, and costs for asthma care exceed $10 billion a year. Asthma is much more prevalent among children than adults.

Hospitalizations for asthma have been increasing among children. For example, from 1979 to 1987, the hospital discharge rate with asthma as the first-listed diagnosis rose 43 percent among children less than 15 years of age, from 19.8 to 28.4 discharges per 10,000 population.

Death rates for asthma are greater in Blacks than in whites, and the difference is increasing. In 1979, Blacks of both sexes were about twice as likely to die from asthma as whites. Over the past decade this ratio has increased, and by 1987 the asthma death rate was almost three times greater among Blacks than whites. In children, these mortality differences between Blacks and whites are even more striking.

Current knowledge about the epidemiology and natural history of childhood asthma is incomplete, but the relationship between asthma early in life and development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adulthood is becoming more apparent. Asthmatic children with persistent and severe asthma symptoms have lower levels of lung function by young adulthood than those with milder disease. Recent longitudinal studies have confirmed a decrease in rate of growth of lung function as measured by FEV1 among symptomatic (primarily wheeze) children compared to asymptomatic children. Among persons who develop COPD, initial level of lung function is the strongest predictor of subsequent rapid decline of ventilatory function.

Thus, less than maximally attained levels of lung function among children with asthma may predispose them to greater than normal decline of lung function later in life. Although the long-term effect of treatment on the course of asthma is not known, the treatment goal of decreasing bronchial hyperresponsiveness and maximizing lung function and growth during childhood may have a beneficial effect on lung health throughout life and prevent progression to irreversible airflow obstruction.

Two classes of medications are currently available for treatment of inflammation--corticosteroids and cromolyn sodium. Inhaled corticosteroids have significantly fewer side effects than systemic administration. Corticosteroids do not inhibit the early asthmatic response, but are effective in suppressing the inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness of the late phase response. Long-term studies of inhaled corticosteroids have shown beneficial effects on lung function as measured by FEV1. However, there has been concern about possible effects of long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids. Although epidemiological studies of the use of inhaled corticosteroids have shown no significant adverse effects, large-scale randomized controlled studies of their effects on children's growth and development are needed.

When CAMP was initiated in the United States, bronchodilator treatment was the most common approach to therapy. Two classes of bronchodilators, inhaled beta-2-adrenergic agonists and oral theophylline, are most frequently prescribed for asthma. To date, no randomized, controlled studies have compared the two classes of anti-inflammatory medications to each other and to bronchodilator therapy on the course of asthma.

The initiative was proposed by the Pulmonary Disease Advisory Committee working group in October 1987 and approved by the full committee at the February 1988 meeting and by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council in May 1990. The Request for Proposals was released in October 1990. Awards were made in September 1991.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Children were randomized to one of three treatment groups to receive either: inhaled albuterol alone, albuterol with inhaled budesonide, albuterol with nedocromil. Upon randomization, data were collected on demographic factors, physical and psychosocial development, clinical factors including medical history and extent of allergies, and quality of life factors including limitation of activity, absenteeism from school, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations. All subjects received a common educational program, differing only in the information presented regarding the medication used by the subjects. Each subject was given a standard protocol for dealing with asthma attacks. All subjects were treated and followed for five years with quarterly visits yearly. Recruitment began in July 1993 and ended in June 1995 with the accrual of 1,041 subjects.

The study has been extended through June 2011 through three funding phases to observe the subjects but not provide asthma treatment. This will allow CAMP to (1.) determine the full impact of 4 to 6 years of anti-inflammatory therapy on attaining maximal lung function and final height; (2.) examine the natural history of asthma through age 26; and (3.) define patterns of reduced lung function growth and early decline of lung function in young adults.",Interventional,"Inclusion criteria:

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a fibrotic/emphysematous lung disorder is a common sequela among extremely premature infants. The severity of BPD, but not incidence, has been reduced by surfactant therapy. BPD remains one of the most significant contributors to excessively prolonged hospital stays and, therefore, potentially avoidable costs. Research leading to a reduction in BPD morbidity should prove cost effective in the estimated 10,400 affected infants annually (40 percent of a projected 26,000 survivors of birthweights less than 1,250 grams).

Inflammation is a significant component of both clinical and experimental model BPD and is the subject of numerous basic science investigations begun since the empiric observation that BPD responds favorably to systemic steroids. The known side effects of systemic steroids have led to their cautious sequential controlled clinical investigation, initially for late treatment (at more than 30 days of age), then early treatment (two weeks), then very early treatment (seven days), and even prophylaxis (day one). The prophylactic clinical trial of inhaled steroids, starting at day three for 21 days, is a logical next step in this sequence of determining the least dangerous, yet effective means to prevent or treat the inflammatory components of BPD.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. The premature infants were randomized to beclomethasone or placebo on day three of life. Beclomethasone was delivered in a decreasing dosage, from 40 to 5 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day, for four days. The primary outcome measure was bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 28 days of age. Secondary outcomes included bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age, the need for systemic glucocorticoid therapy, the need for bronchodilator therapy, the duration of respiratory support, and death.

Clinical sites included the Boston Perinatal Center at the New England Medical Center Hospitals, the Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, and the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. The Data Coordinating Center was at Boston University School of Medicine. Support for the trial ended in April, 1999.

Asthma is an increasingly serious cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. There are approximately 12 million asthmatics, and the disease affects both sexes and impacts all racial and ethnic groups. It is now recognized that asthma is a complex disease of varied etiology, which is triggered by a number of factors (e.g., allergens, drugs, chemicals, exercise, cold air, infections, and emotions), making asthma therapy difficult and sometimes complicated. Multiple drugs, including medications to treat and control symptoms (bronchodilator agents such as beta-adrenergic agonists, theophylline, and anticholinergics) and medications thought to control underlying airway inflammation (e.g., inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, cromolyn sodium, and nedocromil), are often required.

Despite major advances in the understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of asthma and the development of new therapeutic modalities, the prevalence, severity, and mortality from asthma in all age groups have increased over the past decade. Mortality rates are disproportionately high in urban and rural minority populations. Hospitalizations for asthma have doubled in adults and increased five-fold for children over the past 20 years. Asthma continues to place a heavy burden on patients and their families, the health care system, and society as a whole. Therefore, new approaches are needed to help alleviate this growing problem.

A particularly important need at this juncture is a mechanism for the rapid evaluation of new and existing therapeutic approaches for asthma and for the dissemination of laboratory and clinical findings to the health care community. The Asthma Clinical Research Network (ACRN) program seeks to accomplish this through the development of a network of interactive asthma clinical groups that conduct clinical studies employing common protocols in a coordinated and multidisciplinary setting. This will ensure ready access to an adequate number of well characterized patients from diverse populations and age groups. It will also bring together and coordinate the necessary clinical expertise and administrative resources to conduct multiple therapeutic studies. Centralized protocols will promote high quality design, decrease the variability in supportive modalities, and reduce the redundant utilization of resources required for rapidly conducting multiple independent clinical studies. The separate data coordinating center supports protocol and questionnaire development, sample size calculations, complete data analysis, and overall study coordination.

The initiative was developed by the Pulmonary Diseases Advisory Committee working group, approved by the full committee at the February 1992 meeting, and given concept clearance by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Advisory Council in May 1992.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The Beta-Agonist (Bags) study compared the safety and efficacy of regular plus ""as needed"" use of inhaled albuterol to the ""as needed"" use of inhaled albuterol in 255 patients with asthma of mild severity. A total of 230 patients completed the study. The study was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled with parallel groups. Following a 6-week single-blind run-in period, patients were randomized in a double-blind manner and treated for 16 weeks. There was a 4-week withdrawal, or run-out, period. Changes in lung function and asthma symptoms were assessed to determine whether regular or ""as needed"" beta-agonist use was more beneficial in the treatment of mild asthma. Specific outcome measures included morning (AM) PEF, airway responsiveness, spirometric values, evening (PM) to AM PEF difference index, asthma symptoms, quality of life measures, use of rescue medications, and episodes of adverse asthma control. Recruitment began in December 1994. The study has completed and results have been published.

The Colchicine in Moderate Asthma (CIMA) study examined if colchicine offered therapeutic benefit in the management of 71 patients with moderate asthma when corticosteroids were discontinued. The study was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled with two parallel groups. A 2-week run-in with inhaled corticosteroid was followed by 2 weeks with inhaled corticosteroid and colchicine or placebo, and then by 6 weeks with no inhaled corticosteroid but with colchicine or placebo. There was a 6-week single-blind run-out. Outcome measures included treatment failure after cessation of inhaled corticosteroid, FEV1 change, PM to AM PEF difference index, airway responsiveness, asthma symptoms, quality of life measures, use of rescue medications, and episodes of adverse asthma control. The protocol was approved in April 1994. Recruitment ran from February 1996 through August 1996. Results have been published.

The Salmeterol or Corticosteroids (SOCS) study was a randomized, double-blind study to determine the utility of treating patients with moderately severe asthma with long-acting beta-agonists in place of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). A total of 164 patients were randomized into one of the following three treatment arms (double-blind and double-dummy): 1) placebo; 2) inhaled corticosteroid triamcinolone alone; or 3) beta-agonist salmeterol alone. Treatment continued for 16 weeks, followed by a 6-week run-out period in which all patients were placed on placebo. The purpose of the run-out period was to evaluate the effects of treatment cessation on asthma control. To compare efficacy of therapy, the primary outcome variable was the change in AM PEF from the final week of the run-in period to the final week of the double-blind treatment period. To compare duration benefit, the primary outcome variable was again AM PEF, with a comparison of the change from the final week of the run-in period to the second and final weeks of the run-out period. Secondary endpoints included other markers of asthma severity (e.g., FEV1, symptom diaries, beta-agonist rescue, quality-of-life scores, methacholine responsiveness, and asthma exacerbations). To evaluate markers of inflammation, sputum induction was performed on all patients, and bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial biopsy were performed on a subset of patients. Enrollment began in February 1997 and ended in July 1998. Results have been published.

The Salmeterol± Corticosteroids (SLIC) study examined the addition of a long acting beta-agonist, salmeterol, on a scheduled basis for patients with moderate asthma whose symptoms were sub-optimally controlled by using an inhaled beta-agonist on an ""as needed"" basis and an inhaled corticosteroid on a scheduled basis. The study determined if the addition of salmeterol on a scheduled basis permitted a reduction in dose, and/or elimination of inhaled corticosteroids over time, without a concomitant increase in asthmatic symptoms or a decrease in the bronchoprotective effect to aerosolized methacholine. Recruitment of randomized patients with moderate asthma began in January 1997. Additional patients were randomized at the Harlem Center, a center added to the network in December 1995. The enrollment of 175 patients ended in July 1998 and the last patient visits were completed in January 1999. Results have been published.

The Dose of Inhaled Corticosteroids with Equisystemic Effects (DICE) study estimated dose-response curves with respect to adrenal suppression for six distinct inhaled corticosteroids. The inhaled steroids and delivery systems were characterized in terms of systemic effects so that doses that produced ""equi-systemic"" effects could be subsequently compared in future efficacy studies, including the efficacy study ""Measuring Inhaled Corticosteroid Efficacy"" (MICE). In DICE, a total of 156 (58% male and 31% minority) patients with mild to moderate asthma had a baseline visit and a placebo run-in period to practice taking scheduled doses (4 puffs twice a day) from a metered dose inhaler for 1 week. At the second visit, patients were randomized to placebo or to one of the following six steroid arms, including: 1) beclomethasone dipropionate metered dose inhaler (MDI); 2) budesonide dry powder; 3) flunisolide MDI; 4) fluticasone propionate MDI; 5) fluticasone propionate dry powder; or 6) triamcinolone acetonide MDI. The study addressed the following questions: 1) Were there dose-response relationships in the suppression of overnight plasma cortisol with the various inhaled corticosteroids and delivery systems?; 2) If the dose-response relationships existed, at which doses were comparable systemic effects evident as determined by suppression of overnight plasma cortisol?; and 3) If dose-response relationships existed, which dose produced a 10%, 20%, 30%, or 40% suppression of adrenal steroid secretion (cortisol) for each inhaled steroid and delivery system? DICE was initiated in September 1998 and completed in November 1999. Results have been published.

The Measuring Inhaled Corticosteroid Efficacy (MICE) pilot study was approved by the Protocol Review Committee in August 1998. MICE used doses of inhaled corticosteroid for the full MICE protocol as derived from DICE, which induced minimal cortisol suppression (highest deliverable dose that caused less than 5% cortisol suppression), 20% to 30% cortisol suppression, and 40% to 60% cortisol suppression. The intent was to determine if different inhaled corticosteroids, which had equisystemic effects, had differential salutary therapeutic effects in chronic asthma, or if therapeutic efficacy paralleled systemic effects. MICE was a 24-week, randomized, open-label, prospective, multi-center study examining the effect of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and fluticasone propionate (FP) both with an Opti-Chamber spacer device. The inhaled corticosteroids were administered to 30 patients in doses of increasing systemic effect to examine the corresponding effects on pulmonary function, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, asthma control, and resolution of airway inflammation in patients with persistent asthma. The intent was to compare the estimates of systemic effect for BDP and FP, derived from the DICE pilot study in which BDP and FP were administered in 1-week intervals, to that which occurred when BDP and FP doses were administered over 3- to 6-six week intervals with incremental doses. MICE also explored which efficacy/systemic relationships, if any, suggested that there may be a difference between the two prototype inhaled corticosteroids, BDP and FP. Recruitment was completed in the spring of 2000. Results have been published.

The Beta Agonist Response by Genotype (BARGE) study was reviewed by the Protocol Review Committee in December 1998. Recruitment started in September 1999. BARGE was a 54-week randomized, double-blind, crossover study comparing the effects of regularly scheduled use of inhaled albuterol (2 puffs four times a day) to placebo. Two groups of 36 participants each included individuals who had mild to moderate asthma and who differed by their genotype at the codon for the 16th amino acid of the B2-adrenergic receptor. A total of 36 participants harbored the B16-Arg/Arg genotype and the other 36 harbored the B16-Gly/Gly genotype at the B2-adrenergic receptor. Qualified participants entered a 6-week single-blind run-in period during which they were treated with an inhaled placebo (2 puffs 4 times a day) and given inhaled ipratropium bromide for use as a rescue medication. Asthma control was characterized by AM PEF, spirometric values, AM/PM PEF variability index, asthma symptoms, quality of life, use of rescue medications, and occurrence of events of adverse asthma control. Baseline data were obtained on airway responsiveness, the protective effect of albuterol against methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction, the maximum bronchodilator effect of albuterol, and exhaled nitric oxide. Participants were then randomized to a 16-week double-blind treatment phase in which they received either inhaled albuterol or placebo (two puffs 4 times a day). Asthma control was monitored by the above indicators during this time. At the end of the blinded treatment period, all participants were returned to single-blind regular use of a placebo inhaler (2 puffs 4 times a day) for an 8-week run-out period. Following cross-over to double-blinded treatment with albuterol or placebo, the 8-week run-out period also served as the run-in period for the second stage of the study. Asthma control was monitored by the same indicators as in the first stage. At the end of the second blinded treatment period, all participants were returned to single-blind regular use of a placebo inhaler (2 puffs 4 times a day) for an 8-week run-out period. During the entire study, participants used inhaled ipratropium bromide as rescue medication to avoid the confounding effects of B2-adrenergic stimulation on the outcome variables to be monitored. In the event that an episode of adverse asthma control responded incompletely to ipratropium, albuterol was used as a superseding rescue medication. Comparisons of asthma control, within each genotypic group during periods of randomized treatment, were assessed as the difference in the change in outcome variables between the end of Stage 1 randomized treatment and the end of Stage 1 run-in, and between the end of Stage 2 randomized treatment and the end of Stage 1 run-out. The study was completed and results have been published.

The Improving Asthma Control Trial (IMPACT) was a double-blind, randomized, parallel group design clinical study to determine the best long-term strategy for treating adults with mild asthma who experienced symptoms more than occasionally. The study tested whether these patients should be taking anti-inflammatory medications on a daily basis and whether a newer class of medications provided the same benefit as older drugs. In the IMPACT study, 225 adults with mild asthma, who had more than occasional symptoms, were enrolled in six clinical research centers. Following an initial evaluation, patients were randomized to receive either a twice daily inhaled corticosteroid, a twice daily anti-leukotriene, or a placebo. All patients received treatment for symptoms if, and when, they occured. The primary outcome was AM PEF. Other outcomes included FEV1 before and after bronchodilator treatment, the frequency of exacerbations, the degree of asthma control, the number of symptom-free days, and the quality of life. Recruitment ended in 2003. Study results were published in the April 14, 2005 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. In April 2001 NHLBI initiated an ancillary study to IMPACT entitled ""Modification of Allergic Immunologic Response by Leukotriene Antagonists"" under R01HL67684. The ancillary study has its own site in this database.

The Smoking Modulates Outcomes of Glucocorticoid Therapy in Asthma (SMOG) study was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, which compared the effect of inhaled corticosteroid treatment delivered twice daily for 8 weeks in the following two groups of patients with persistent asthma: 1) smokers; and 2) non-smokers. Smokers and non-smokers were matched into pairs according to gender and FEV1 status prior to the run-in period. Each member of the matched pair was randomized together to the same crossover sequence. There were 96 patients ages 18 to 35. The primary outcome was change in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 over the 8-week treatment period in smokers compared with non-smokers. Secondary outcomes were AM and PM PEF, PC20 methacholine, and markers of inflammation in induced sputum. A secondary comparison examined the effect of 8 weeks of treatment with a leukotriene receptor antagonist in asthmatics who smoked to those who did not. An additional analysis compared the response to inhaled corticosteroid with the response to leukotriene receptor antagonist. The study was completed and results have been submitted to a journal for publication.

The Salmeterol and Leukotriene Modifiers versus ICS Treatment (SLIMSIT) study initiated recruitment in September 2002. The goal was to randomize 180 participants. SLIMSIT was a 36-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, with time to treatment failure as the primary endpoint. Prior to each double-blind treatment phase, participants underwent a 4-week run-in period with combined inhaled beclomethasone HFA and the leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) montelukast. This was followed by 14 weeks of double-blind treatment. During the initial 4-week run-in period, participants who met National Asthma Education Program criteria for moderate persistent asthma received a controller regimen to obtain baseline information on symptoms, beta-agonist use, and PEF for use in defining treatment failure for each participant over the duration of the study. The final visit of this run-in period served as the baseline of comparison for the study variables measured during the initial treatment phase. At the end of the initial run-in, participants with stable asthma symptoms were randomized to one of the following two treatment regimens for 14 weeks: 1) daily oral placebo, twice daily inhalation of salmeterol 50 mg by dry powder inhaler (DPI), and twice daily inhalation of beclomethasone HFA 80 mg by MDI; or 2) once daily oral montelukast 10 mg, twice daily inhalation of salmeterol 50 mg by DPI, and twice daily inhalation of placebo. Active beclomethasone HFA and the beclomethasone HFA placebo were given via a MDI delivery device, while salmeterol was given by a DPI Diskusâ. A computer interface randomized participants into the two treatment groups, stratifying by clinical center and FEV1 at the randomization visit (less than 80% versus greater than 80% of predicted FEV1). During the first treatment period, participants made three visits to the clinic over 14 weeks. These visits included re-assessment of the study variables and careful monitoring for increasing asthma symptoms and potential treatment failure. Subsequently, participants entered a second run-in period in which they received single-blind treatment with inhaled beclomethasone HFA and oral montelukast as in the first run-in period. At the end of the second run-in period, participants crossed over to the alternate treatment regimen for the second 14-week treatment phase, which included three visits to the clinic. These visits again included re-assessment of the study variables and careful monitoring for increasing asthma symptoms and potential treatment failure. DSMB recommended termination of the study prior to target enrollment because sufficient data about the primary outcome had been obtained. SLIMSIT results were presented at the May 2005 American Thoracic Society Annual Meeting. The data are under analysis for subsequent publication.

The Predicting Responses for Inhaled Corticosteroid Efficacy (PRICE) study was a follow-up study that looked for additional predictive biomarkers of response to inhaled corticosteroids. The study also evaluated whether short-term response to inhaled corticosteroids predicted asthma control and exacerbation rate, and whether it correlated with elastic recoil and upstream resistance. In this study, adults with a history of asthma underwent 6 weeks of ICS treatment, then were stratified by response and randomized in a double-blind fashion to continue ICS therapy or receive placebo for 16 weeks. ACRN investigators found that after 6 weeks of ICS therapy, patients with a good (15%) versus poor (less than 5%) increase in FEV1 experienced significantly better asthma control during continued ICS treatment. Interestingly, nitric oxide concentration in exhaled breath and airway sputum eosinophils, generally considered biomarkers of airway inflammation, were not significantly correlated with ICS treatment response. Explanation for this divergence in findings is unclear. PRICE results were presented at the May 2005 American Thoracic Society Annual Meeting

In the Genetics of Asthma in Latino Americans (GALA) study, two ACRN centers compared asthma-related clinical characteristics of 684 Mexican and Puerto Rican asthmatics recruited from San Francisco, New York City, Puerto Rico, and Mexico City. Results of the published study indicate that asthmatic Puerto Ricans had reduced lung function, greater morbidity, and longer asthma duration than asthmatic Mexicans.

The ACRN was renewed in September 2003 through July 2008. New protocols are under development and underway.

The Long Acting Beta Agonist Response by GEnotype (LARGE) study is the first protocol of ACRN II. It is a 60-week randomized, double-blind, cross-over study to compare the effects of long-acting beta-agonists in patients with asthma who are receiving inhaled corticosteroids and who express two distinct polymorphisms of the beta2-adrenergic receptor. The primary hypothesis is that those with the B16 Arg/Arg genotype will have worse asthma control, as defined by AM PEF rate, than those with the B16 Guj/Guj genotype. Recruitment started in December 2004 with a target of 80 randomized patients.

Both studies were conducted in the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Unit (MFMU) Network, an ongoing group of participating obstetric centers supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Studies were co-funded by the NHLBI.","BACKGROUND:

Asthma is one of the most common illnesses that complicates pregnancy. Asthma complicates at least 4 percent of all pregnancies; however, because at least 10 percent of the population appears to have nonspecific airway hyper-responsiveness, the true prevalence may be much higher.

Asthma can produce serious maternal and fetal complications. A number of investigators have reported an increased incidence of pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, hyperemesis gravidarum, vaginal hemorrhage, toxemia, and induced and complicated labor. Fetal complications include increased risk of perinatal mortality, prematurity, low birth weight, and neonatal hypoxia. In contrast, several studies have failed to confirm some or all of these previous observations. Patients with severe asthma may have the greatest risk for complications during pregnancy, in addition to the risk of maternal morbidity from the asthma. For example, it has been shown that reduced pulmonary function in asthmatic women is associated with an increased likelihood of intrauterine growth retardation. On the other hand, studies in which asthma was successfully controlled have resulted in pregnancy outcomes similar to the general population.

The mechanisms by which asthma may have adverse perinatal effects are not well known. Poor control of asthma leading to chronic or episodic fetal hypoxia is thought to be important. Medications used in asthma treatment may also play a role, although the limited data suggests minimal or no effects. In addition, it is possible that extrapulmonary autonomic nervous system abnormalities, such as uterine muscle hyperreactivity, could contribute to pre-term delivery or gestational hypertension independent of asthma control or therapy.

Unfortunately, previous studies have been limited by relatively small numbers. Few studies have controlled for factors known to affect infant birth weight, such as maternal race, height, weight, parity, nutrition, and cigarette smoking. Particularly, race may be an important contributing factor in assessing the relationship between asthma and pregnancy outcomes, since Blacks of both sexes are twice as likely to be hospitalized from asthma and three times as likely to die from asthma as whites.

Under the auspices of the National Asthma Education Program (NAEP), a Working Group on Asthma and Pregnancy developed a statement regarding the treatment of asthma during pregnancy. In its deliberations, the Working Group noted the paucity of data on the relative contributions of biological, social, and environmental factors on asthma in pregnant women, as well as the lack of data on the efficacy and safety of commonly used asthma therapies in pregnancy.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The Asthma in Pregnancy Study evaluated the relationship between maternal asthma severity and control. The primary objective was to determine the frequency of preterm delivery <32 weeks among moderate and severe asthmatics compared to non-asthmatic controls. The incidence of small-for-gestational-age infants in women with mild and moderate asthma was a secondary outcome. Other independent variables included type of medications used, race, socioeconomic status, height, weight, parity, nutrition, smoking, other substance abuse, and prenatal care. Secondary outcomes included birth weight and prematurity, maternal pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, and asthma morbidity. The study began February 1,1995 and patient recruitment continued for 46 months or less.

The Asthma Therapy in Pregnancy Trial was a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial which began recruitment in November, 1996, with enrollment lasting 44 months. Patients were randomized to receive either active oral theophylline and a placebo beclomethasone inhaler or an active beclomethasone inhaler and placebo oral theophylline. Albuterol was used for relief of symptoms. The primary outcome measure was incidence of Emergency Department visits or hospitalizations during pregnancy. Secondary outcome measures included birth weight, incidence of small-for-gestational-age infants, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, lung function, daily peak flow, and quality of life. Patients were seen monthly for measurements of fetal growth, morbidity, and lung function. Extensive interviews were conducted with each patient at the first prenatal visit, in the third trimester, and shortly before birth.

ARDS affects approximately 150,000 people in the United States each year. Despite 20 years of research into the mechanisms that cause this syndrome and numerous developments in the technology of mechanical ventilation, the mortality has remained greater than 50 percent. Many of the patients are young, and to the tragic loss of human life can be added the cost to society because these patients spend an average of 2 weeks in intensive care units and require multiple high tech procedures. Because of the overwhelming nature of the lung injury once it is established, prevention would appear to be the most effective strategy for improving the outlook in this condition.

Basic research has identified numerous inflammatory pathways that are associated with the development of ARDS. Agents that block these mediators prolong survival in animals with lung injury, and a few of them have been tested in patients. Because of the large number of putative mediators and the variety of ways that their action can be blocked, the possibility for new drug development is almost infinite. This is an exciting prospect, since it envisions the first effective pharmacologic treatment for ARDS. However, preliminary clinical studies have shown conflicting results, and there is an urgent need for a mechanism to efficiently and effectively test new drugs in ARDS.

Treatment studies in patients with ARDS are difficult to perform for three reasons. The complicated clinical picture makes it difficult to accumulate a large number of comparable patients in any one center. There is no agreement on the optimal supportive care of these critically ill patients. Many of the patients meeting study criteria will not be enrolled in study protocols because of the acute nature of the disease process. For these reasons, therapeutic trials in ARDS require multicenter cooperation.

The concept for the initiative was first discussed at a meeting of the Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome Foundation and staff of the Division of Lung Diseases. The results of a working meeting on uniform definitions in ARDS held at the 1992 meeting of the American Thoracic Society reinforced the recommendation from the community for National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute participation in drug evaluation in ARDS. The concept for the initiative was approved by the September 1992 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The Requests for Proposals were released in October 1993.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

It is anticipated that over the 12-year period, several multicenter clinical trials will be developed and implemented. A 12-month Phase I period was devoted to planning and developing the infrastructure and committee structure and to protocol development and prioritization. In Phase IIa, staff are trained in data acquisition procedures and patients are enrolled. Additional protocol development may begin for subsequent studies. In Phase IIb, after the last patients in the first study have completed their follow-up measurements, data will be reviewed and the initial study will be closed out. Protocol development continues for subsequent trials. In Phase III, final data analysis and publication preparation will occur.

Enrollment of 1,000 patients into the first ARDSNet protocol, ""Ketoconazole and Respiratory Management in Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"" (KARMA) began in the spring of 1996. KARMA assessed the efficacy of 6 ml/kg versus 12 ml/kg positive pressure ventilation in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS. It also assessed the efficacy of ketoconazole, a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS. The ketoconazole arm was stopped by the Data Monitoring Safety Board (DSMB) in January 1997 after the enrollment of 234 patients. Ketoconazole did not show any benefit in survival, duration of ventilation, or any measure of lung function. The ventilator arm of the protocol continued until March 10, 1999, and compared the efficacy of high (12 ml/kg) and low (6 ml/kg) tidal volume ventilation in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS. The ventilator portion of the trial was stopped on March 10, 1999, on the recommendation of the DSMB when the data from the first 861 patients showed approximately 25 percent fewer deaths among patients receiving small, rather than large, breaths of air from the mechanical ventilator.

A new drug, lisofylline, was selected to replace ketoconazole in the factorial design ventilation protocol. The lisofylline study (LARMA) began in February 1998. The study tested the efficacy of lisofylline, an analog of pentoxifylline, that has been shown to protect against tissue injury mediated by oxidants and to suppress production of a number of cytokine mediators that amplify the inflammatory process. Patients were randomized to either the high or low tidal volume ventilation treatment group and between lisofylline and placebo. The aim of the lisofylline protocol was to determine whether the administration of lisofylline early after the onset of acute lung injury or ARDS would reduce morbidity or mortality. The study was cosponsored by Cell Therapeutics Incorporated. The trial was stopped by the DSMB on May 27, 1999, after results were obtained on 221 patients. There was no effect on mortality, time on ventilation, or organ failure.

The ""Late Steroid Rescue Study (LaSRS): The Efficacy of Corticosteroids as Rescue Therapy for the Late Phase of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"" (LaSRS is pronounced ""Lazarus"") compared the effect of corticosteroids with placebo in the management of late-phase (greater than 7 days) ARDS. The study determined if the administration of the corticosteroid, methylprednisolone sodium succinate, in severe ARDS that was either stable or worsening after 7 days, would reduce mortality and morbidity. The primary end point was mortality at 60 days. Secondary endpoints included ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days. LaSRS was designed to include 400 patients and began recruiting in the spring of 1997. In October 1999, the DSMB reduced the recruitment target number to 200 patients because the eligible patients were fewer than anticipated.

In November 1999, the Network began a new trial as a follow-on to the ventilator trial that has been named the ""Assessment of Low Tidal Volume and Elevated End-Expiratory Pressure to Obviate Lung Injury"" (ALVEOLI). This trial was a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter trial that included 549 patients and compared two groups of patients. Patients were randomized to receive mechanical ventilation with either lower or higher PEEP, which were set according to different tables of predetermined combinations of PEEP and fraction of inspired oxygen. The primary end point was mortality at 60 days. Secondary endpoints included ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days. The trial has ended and results were published in the July 22, 2004, issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The results suggest that in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS who receive mechanical ventilation with a tidal-volume goal of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an end-inspiratory plateau-pressure limit of 30 centimeters of water, clinical outcomes are similar whether lower or higher PEEP levels are used.

Network investigators have developed a plan for a new protocol to assess the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) as a management tool in ARDS. The new study was prompted by recommendations from the FDA/NIH Pulmonary Artery Catheter Clinical Outcomes workshop convened in August 1997 in response to concerns in the medical community regarding the clinical benefit and safety of PACs. The new protocol in the Fluids and Catheters Treatment Trial (FACTT) is a two-by-two factorial design comparing the patients receiving PAC or a central venous catheter (CVC) with one of two fluid management strategies (conservative versus liberal). The randomized, multicenter trial is designed to include 1,000 patients. The primary end point is mortality at 60 days. Secondary endpoints include ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days. See NCT00281268 for more information on this study.

Albuterol versus Placebo in Acute Lung Injury (ALTA) Study: The Phase II/III study will test the safety and efficacy of aerosolized beta-2 adrenergic agonist therapy (albuterol sulfate) for reducing mortality in patients with acute lung injury. In Phase II, the safety of albuterol at the 5-mg dose will be compared to saline in approximately 100 patients. The dose will be reduced to 2.5 mg if patients exceed defined heart rate limits. Consequently, a Phase III placebo-controlled double-blinded, randomized trial on approximately 1,000 patients will compare 60-day mortality and ventilator-free days to Day 28 between the safe albuterol dose established in Phase II and placebo saline.

New efforts have been initiated to increase sample collection and utilize collected patient materials to investigate mechanisms of ARDS pathogenesis. In addition to investigations of hypotheses related to cytokines and inflammatory mediators, the Network is preparing to collect samples for future studies of genetic determinants of ARDS.

A baseline study on the vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus in Taiwan revealed that 15 percent of all pregnant women were persistent carriers of hepatitis B antigen and that 40 percent of their new babies developed a protracted antigenemia during the first 6 months of life. The incidence of acute hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatoma was high in Taiwan, and patients with these disorders had a fivefold to sixfold higher prevalence of hepatitis B antigen than healthy persons. Given the important public health problems of this disease in Taiwan and the rest of the Third World, this trial sought to answer the important question of whether hepatitis B immune globulin with a high level of antibody against the antigen would be of utility in combating the problem.

Two hundred and five babies were accepted into the study, which was actually conducted on Taiwan through a contract to the Community Blood Council of Greater New York. Only those babies born of mothers who had HBsAg complement fixation titers of 1:8 or greater were included in these studies. At birth, blood was obtained from the mothers and cord blood from the infants. Follow-up bloods were obtained from both the mother and baby when the infants were 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months of age. In addition, all household family contacts were bled at least once during this period.

The study trials were conducted simultaneously.,"BACKGROUND:

Infection remains a major cause of death in patients receiving chemotherapy for malignant diseases. One approach to the problem of septicemia and high mortality in these patients was the therapeutic use of granulocyte transfusions. Improvements in collection techniques, employing continuous flow centrifugation, permitted the collection of granulocytes from a single, normal donor in sufficient numbers to study their application in the treatment of infections in granulocytopenic patients. Studies had demonstrated the efficacy of granulocyte transfusions as an adjunct in the therapy of septicemia due to gram negative microorganisms associated with granulocytopenia.

The aims of the study were to determine (1) whether infections could be prevented in patients who received granulocytes prophylactically and (2) whether recovery from infection was aided in patients who received granulocytes therapeutically. Both trials utilized controls who received no granulocytes.

Four contracts were awarded in September 1976. The protocol designed to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions was completed at the close of 1977. The protocol for the therapeutic trial was completed in April 1978. Approximately 90 patients were randomized in the prophylactic trial and 51 in the therapeutic trial. The Recruitment and Intervention Phase ended in February 1980. The trial has concluded.

Despite major advances in the treatment of patients with hemophilia, a serious remaining challenge was presented by the occurrence of circulating inhibitors to Factor VIII. Because of lack of information on the natural course of patients with Factor VIII inhibitors, the relative efficacy of various modes of therapy was not established. The Division of Blood Diseases and Resources decided to sponsor a clinical investigation which would evaluate populations of hemophilia patients for Factor VIII inhibitors, follow up these patients to provide information on the natural history of the inhibitor in the hemophilia patients, and make available a reference center to monitor results and attain uniformity.

Treatment of a patient with a severe inhibitor and consequent bleeding remained a problem. Management included protracted treatment with Factor VIII, use of immunosuppressive agents and prothrombin complex (or Factor IX) concentrates. The rationale for Factor IX was that it bypassed the defect in Factor VIII caused by the inhibitor. This method of therapy attracted wide popularity, but the success was greatly debated. It was intended at the very outset of the Factor VIII study that therapeutic trials involving patients with inhibitors would not be a prime function, but that such studies would be monitored if necessary. A controlled trial of Factor IX concentrates therapy was strongly advised by the DBDR Advisory Committee. Accordingly, during fiscal year 1978, a protocol for a double-blind control study was developed by the Factor VIII inhibitor group. The trial began in the spring of 1978, and the intervention terminated about one year later.

Although most carriers of HBsAg are asymptomatic, a substantial proportion eventually develop chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis. There is also overwhelming evidence that the hepatitis B virus is the single most important causative factor of hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, mass immunization programs against HBV infection may ultimately affect not only the incidence of acute hepatitis B and the pool of chronic carriers but may also reduce the morbidity and mortality from chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Krugman and his co-workers laid the groundwork for active immunization against hepatitis B in 1970 to 1973. They discovered that a 1:10 dilution of hepatitis B infective serum lost its infectivity when boiled for one minute but retained its antigenicity and prevented hepatitis B in 70 percent of vaccinated subjects. Hilleman and his colleagues at the Merck Institute of Therapeutic Research developed a more sophisticated vaccine consisting of highly purified, formalin-inactivated HBsAg particles derived from the plasma of chronic carriers of the antigen. By 1978, data were sufficient to permit testing in a clinical trial.

The first subject was inoculated in November 1978, and by October 1979, recruitment had ended. In May 1980, all trial events were reviewed and classified by an expert panel. In June 1980 the code of vaccine and placebo allocation was broken.

Premature infants who require multiple blood transfusions have a 15-30 percent incidence of cytomegalovirus infections. Many of these infections result in severe disease, with a mortality of about 20 percent. In theory, the infection could be avoided by using blood and blood products exclusively from CMV antibody negative donors. The use of such blood is impractical because it would require the rejection of approximately 40 percent of all blood donors. Studies had suggested that passively acquired antibody could reduce the incidence of disease in exposed neonates. This provided the rationale for the use of passive immunization with hyperimmune globin in premature infants likely to require multiple transfusions. Lots of high titer CMV immune globulin suitable for intravenous administration were prepared using a technique of screening outdated blood bank plasma for units with high levels of antibody to CMV.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind. Subjects received either prophylactic CMVIG-intravenously or a placebo. Infants were followed for up to 12 weeks after discharge. Total sample size was expected to be 650.

For over 20 years children with sickle cell anemia have been known to have an increased susceptibility to severe bacterial infection, particularly due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Meningitis, pneumonia and septicemia due to this organism have been recognized as the major causes of death for these children, with children under three years of age being at highest risk. The annual incidence of pneumococcal septicemia among young children with sickle cell anemia appears to have remained remarkably constant over the last two decades at approximately 10 percent. This illness can often be fulminant, progressing from the onset of fever to death in less than 12 hours, with a case fatality rate ranging as high as 35 percent.

Penicillin prophylaxis has been advocated as a preventive measure against severe pneumococcal infections in children with sickle cell anemia. One study had shown that the risk of pneumococcal infection in these children could be reduced by the use of parenteral penicillin.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Phase I was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred and five patients were assigned to the penicillin group and 110 to placebo. The primary endpoint was a documented severe infection due to S. pneumoniae. The secondary endpoint was a severe infection due to an organism other than S. pneumoniae.

Because data were not available to define the age at which prophylactic penicillin could be safely discontinued, the NHLBI launched Phase II of the Prophylactic Penicillin Study beginning in 1987. Recruitment ended in August, 1993. The clinical phase of Phase II ended in August, 1994.

Phase II was a multi-center randomized trial to evaluate the hazards of discontinuing daily oral penicillin at the age of five years. Within three months of their fifth birthdays, all children were randomized to continue oral penicillin prophylaxis or to stop prophylaxis. Each child was followed for a minimum of two years. The primary endpoint was a comparison of documented pneumococcal infection in children continuing penicillin after five years of age versus children whose prophylaxis was stopped at five years of age. Ancillary studies conducted in subsets of patients included: the prevalence of colonization of the nasopharynx with antibiotic resistant microorangisms; and the relationship of antibody response to pneumococcal vaccination to the incidence of pneumococcal sepsis in this patient population.",Interventional,"In the Phase I trial, Black children with sickle cell anemia aged 3 months to 3 years.

In spite of the fact that advances have been made in the management or prevention of some of the complications of sickle cell disease, the management of the most common complication--the painful crisis--is still unsatisfactory, and appropriate methods for its prevention are unknown. The morbidity associated with a painful crisis is much more than the suffering from pain alone. The interference with a normal lifestyle, the resulting obstacles to obtaining an education and holding a job, the risk of narcotics addiction, the cost of multiple hospitalizations, and the financial impact on the family and the individual must all be considered.

Evidence from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) study showed that there is an association between multiple pain events and early death in young adults. If this association is true, then MSH has the potential to not only reduce morbidity but mortality as well. The CSSCD study has shown that over 50 percent of patients with sickle cell disease have at least one crisis per year, and a considerable number have more. These episodes are believed to occur as a result of hemoglobin S within the red cells leading to rigid, non-deformable cells which can no longer traverse the microvasculature and as a result produce obstruction with consequent pain, ischemia, and tissue necrosis.

Previous approaches to the therapy of this group of disorders have included: attempts to modify the hemoglobin molecule so as to prevent polymerization; the use of vasoreactive drugs; and increasing red cell volume. All of these attempts have been abandoned either because of their inefficacy, toxicity, or impracticality. Chronic exchange transfusion programs have been of limited usefulness because of high rates of isoimmunization, iron overload, and risk of transmission of hepatitis and retroviral disease.

The rationale for the present study draws its substance from the observation that patients with higher levels of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) (particularly the Saudi Arabian group), and infants who also have high Hb F levels have fewer crises. Several myelosuppressive drugs, such as 5-azacytidine and hydroxyurea, have been shown to increase Hb F production. The work with 5-azacytidine has had to be abandoned because of the known risk of malignancy.

Preliminary studies by the investigators and others have shown convincingly that Hb F levels can be increased by administering hydroxyurea to patients over a several month period without producing dangerous levels of myelosuppression. The patients have also had a rise in their red cell life span and hematocrit. Further, it has been reported that these patients had a dramatic decrease in crisis frequency. This agent is readily available to all physicians, and there is evidence that it is being used without adequate justification and, possibly, without adequate monitoring. The timing of this study is therefore critical to ensure that an adequate answer to the question of efficacy is obtained and the risk of inappropriate use minimized.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Phase I has concluded. Phase II, also concluded, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients in the Phase II trial were recruited from 21 clinics and randomized to receive hydroxyurea or placebo. The hydroxyurea was gradually increased from an initial dose of 15 mg/kg to the maximal level tolerated by each patient in order to maximize red blood cell hemoglobin F(Hb F) content without undue marrow suppression. Changes in Hb F production were monitored in each of the two groups by a variety of laboratory tests. The primary endpoint was a comparison of crisis rates in the treated and control groups. Painful crises were defined as pain lasting longer than four hours, requiring parenteral narcotics for relief, including chest syndrome but excluding ankle ulcer pain. Secondary endpoints included changes in pain severity and duration, psychosocial status, complications of the disease, and reasons for non-compliance with either regimen. Patients were followed for two to three years depending on when they entered the study. Because of the mutagenic nature of hydroxyurea, the use of contraception was a requirement of admission to the study.

The trial was stopped early, on January 14, 1995, instead of in May 1995. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board determined that daily doses of hydroxyurea reduced the frequency of painful episodes and hospital admissions for those crises by about 50 percent.

Beginning in 1996, a five year follow-up of the adult patients in MSH was initiated. The purpose was to ascertain the long-term effects of hydroxyurea in this patient population. Patients were followed annually to determine health status, quality of life, incidence of malignancies, and birth defects in their offspring. In addition, mortality rates were determined so that a comparison could be made between this cohort and the mortality data from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) adult cohort and the normal African-American population mortality data. The follow-up was conducted in three phases. Phase I or the Planning Phase in which the final protocol was developed, lasted three months. Phase II, patient entry between March 1996 and June 1996 and patient follow-up, extended from the fourth to the 48th month. Phase III, patient exit and data analysis, were carried out during the final nine months of the study.

The DSMB stopped MSH Phase III early because the study showed that hydroxyurea substantially reduced the frequency of vaso-occlusive (painful) crises.",Interventional,"Men and women, ages 18 to 50, who had at least three emergency room visits or hospitalizations for sickle cell anemia during the year prior to recruitment.

Reports had shown that between 24 and 78 percent of patients with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome treated with zidovudine for four to six months developed significant bone marrow toxicity, requiring zidovudine dosage alterations, blood transfusions, or cessation of therapy. While zidovudine efficacy had been demonstrated in patients with AIDS or ARC, it was also evaluated in patients with AIDS-related illness, as well as in asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals. The clinically significant zidovudine-induced anemia developing in a substantial number of these patient groups and requiring blood transfusions could cause a significant drain on the blood supply in the United States.

The project was part of an Institute-initiated study on the Pathobiology of Bone Marrow Suppression in AIDS or AIDS-Related Complex. The concept was approved at the May 1987 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The Request for Applications was released in December 1987.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Double-blind, placebo-controlled. Patients received intravenous REPO (1000 IU/kg) or placebo twice per week. The five patients in Group A had no transfusion history. The five patients in Group B had a history of transfusions. Prior to the study, the authors determined that treatment would continue for twelve weeks or until the hemoglobin reached 12.5 g/dl.

Iron overload in patients with refractory anemia may be the consequence of repeated blood transfusion, of excessive absorption of dietary iron, or of a combination of both. The body lacks any effective means for the excretion of excess iron and in patients with refractory anemia, an inexorable accumulation of iron contained in transfused red cells or absorbed from the diet eventually exceeds the body's capacity for safe storage. Without treatment, widespread iron-induced damage to the liver, heart, pancreas, and other organs is followed by an early death, most often the result of cardiac failure.

Treatment with a chelating agent capable of sequestering iron and permitting its excretion from the body is the most widely-used therapeutic approach. Desferrioxamine was first introduced 30 years ago and is the only iron-chelating agent now in clinical use. A number of recent studies have shown that regular chelation therapy with desferrioxamine can prevent organ damage and improve survival in transfusion-dependent patients with thalassemia major and other disorders. However, desferrioxamine given orally is poorly absorbed and to be effective must be given by subcutaneous or intravenous infusion using a small portable syringe pump, ideally for 12 hours each day. Compliance with this regimen is frequently poor, particularly in adolescents with thalassemia major who may be at greatest risk for the lethal complications of iron overload. With modern transfusion programs, one of the main threats to life in patients with transfusion-dependent anemias is non-compliance with iron-chelation therapy. Moreover, the cost of desferrioxamine therapy in transfusion-dependent therapy exceeds $10,000 per year, in part because the drug must be isolated from bacterial cultures. Despite the limitations, trials of desferrioxamine have validated iron chelation as a therapeutic approach to iron overload.

PIH was first recognized as an effective iron chelator in vitro in 1979. It is easily produced by the Schiff base condensation of two widely used, inexpensive drugs, vitamin B-6 (pyridoxal) and the antituberculous agent isoniazid. The recent Phase I studies of low-dose PIH in healthy controls and volunteers with iron overload have found no evidence of toxicity while producing an amount of iron excretion that would be clinically useful in the treatment of non-transfusion-dependent patients with iron-loading anemias. The trial should provide evidence that orally-administered PIH can be substituted for chronic subcutaneous infusions of desferrioxamine in the management of iron overload in refractory anemia.

The trial was part of an Institute-initiated study on Iron Overload: Cooley's Anemia and Other Disorders.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

There were three studies in the Phase II trial. Study 1 demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of oral PIH in reducing the body iron burden to near-normal levels in non-transfusion-dependent patients with iron-loading anemias. Study 2 demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of oral PIH in maintaining near-normal body iron stores in transfusion-dependent patients who had previously been well-chelated with chronic subcutaneous or intravenous desferrioxamine. Study 3 demonstrated safety and effectiveness of oral PIH in reducing the body iron burden to near normal levels in iron-loaded transfusion-dependent patients. Studies 1 and 2 were carried out concurrently. Study 3 began after the methods used in the first two studies documented a sufficient level of iron excretion to permit the iron-loaded transfusion patients to keep pace with ongoing transfusional loading and excrete previous accumulations of iron. After an initial 21 day balance study to demonstrate that a selected dose of PIH produced sufficient iron excretion, patients were begun on chronic therapy. PIH or placebo were given on days 4 to 9 and days 13 to 18 in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. Study 4 demonstrated the effectiveness in 21 patients of oral deferiprone in inducing sustained decreases in body iron concentrations compatible with the avoidance of complications from iron overload.

Repeat balance studies were carried out at three months, six months, and thereafter at least annually with hematological and biochemical parameters monitored at weekly intervals for the first month, at biweekly intervals for the next two months, and at least monthly thereafter.

Between 1971 and 1980, there was a 598 percent increase in the use of platelet concentrates from 0.41 million to more than 2.86 million annually. In contrast, red cell transfusions in the United States rose concurrently from 6.3 million annually to 9.9 million, an increase of 58 percent. Although red cell transfusions have leveled or even decreased slightly in the past several years, the use of platelets has continued to increase at a rate of at least 5 to 10 percent each year. This dramatic and continued increase in the use of platelet concentrates is largely the result of treating thrombocytopenic cancer patients. In addition, open heart surgery patients and others given massive transfusions also receive substantial platelet support. Nevertheless, it is the chronically transfused thrombocytopenic patient who frequently develops platelet alloimmunization and accounts for a large percentage of the increased demand for platelets. A recent survey in a large transfusion service indicated that 8 percent of the patients had received 35 percent of the random-donor pooled platelet concentrates. Although some alloimmunized patients can be supported by HLA-matched, apheresis-donor platelets, suitably matched donors are not available in sufficient numbers for every patient. Thus, platelet transfusion programs that could prevent, or at least delay platelet alloimmunization would be of substantial benefit.

Limited studies have suggested several approaches that may reduce or prevent platelet alloimmunization: reducing the number of foreign antigens to which a recipient is exposed by providing single donor platelet apheresis products; providing leukocyte-poor blood products; inactivating donor antigen presenting cells (APC's), a type of lymphocyte contained within the transfused platelet products, by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of platelet concentrates.

The initiative was recommended by the Blood Diseases and Resources Advisory Committee in May 1987 and approved by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council in September 1987. The Requests for Applications were released in June 1988.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind. There were three treatment arms and one control arm. Patients in the treatment arms received either leukocyte-poor filtered pooled random donor platelets, or ultraviolet irradiated pooled random donor platelets, or leukocyte-poor filtered single donor apheresis platelets. Patients in the control group received routinely pooled, random-donor platelets. Patients remained on their assigned treatments for all transfusions through eight weeks. Assigned transfusions were discontinued only in the event of severe adverse reaction to the platelet transfusions, granulocyte transfusions, bone marrow transplant, withdrawal of informed consent, or death. Pre- and post transfusion counts were obtained for all platelet transfusions. Each patient was followed for one year. Recruitment continued through March 1995. Data analysis ended in July 1997.

Conducted in collaboration with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The trial was Pediatric ACTG Protocol 185.,"BACKGROUND:

The HIV epidemic in the United States has changed its course in the past few years. The main risk group of the past, homosexual males, has reduced numbers of new infections because of education and prevention. Other groups, including intravenous drug abusers, disadvantaged urban socioeconomic classes and adolescents, continue to be infected and to transmit HIV by needle sharing and/or unprotected heterosexual activity. Many of these newly infected individuals are women of child-bearing age. These women in turn infect their children. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that there will be 2,000 infected infants born to 6,000 HIV-positive mothers annually in the United States.

Over the past few years, several studies have identified the risk of maternal-fetal transmission of HIV by seropositive mothers. The risk is close to 30 percent. However, for reasons not yet understood, the risk appears to be higher in Africa, approaching 40 percent, and lower in Europe, approaching 16 percent. Factors influencing maternal-fetal transmission of HIV are not well defined but may include the clinical state of the mother, plasma p24 antigen positivity of the mother, viral load, prior pregnancy associated with maternal-fetal HIV transmission, absence of maternal epitope specific and/or high affinity gp120 antibodies, or prematurity.

The results of a Phase III, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerance of zidovudine for the prevention of HIV transmission from infected pregnant women to their infants (ACTG protocol 076) provided for the first time proof of the concept that a preventive intervention can reduce vertical HIV transmission (47). Based on analysis of data for 364 evaluable births, zidovudine (ZDV or AZT) treatment according to the regimen employed in ACTG 076 appeared to reduce the risk of HIV transmission by two thirds, from 25.5 percent to 8.3 percent. Eligible subjects were HIV-infected pregnant women who had received no antiretroviral therapy during their current pregnancy, who had no maternal clinical indications for antiretroviral therapy, and who had CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts above 200 per microliter at study entry.

Efficacy of ZDV for reduction of vertical HIV transmission in women with advanced HIV disease who are already receiving antiretroviral treatment according to current clinical indications for their own health, or with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of 200 per microliter or below, or both was not evaluated in ACTG 076.

Administration of an antiretroviral agent to a pregnant woman in theory could reduce the risk of neonatal infection by reducing the exposure of the fetus to maternal virus, or by prophylaxis of the fetus prior to exposure. Because it is postulated that intense exposure of a potentially uninfected fetus to HIV present in maternal blood and genital tract secretions occurs during parturition, the design of this study includes intrapartum administration of ZDV followed by six weeks of oral ZDV to the infant.

An identical regimen for ZDV administration was employed in ACTG Protocol 076.

Pediatric ACTG Protocol 185 evaluated the hypothesis that in HIV-infected pregnant women receiving oral ZDV for medical indications, HIVIG administered monthly beginning at 20-30 weeks gestation in combination with intravenous ZDV intrapartum, together with a single newborn dose of HIVIG within 12 hours after birth in combination with six weeks of newborn oral ZDV, would reduce vertical HIV transmission compared with IVIG administered identically as a control agent.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind, controlled. Approximately half of the women were given intravenous HIVIG every four weeks until delivery. The other half received standard intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) without anti-HIV antibody. Both groups received AZT. A similar dose of HIVIG or IVIG was given to the newborn infant within 12 hours of birth. Each infant of a multiple birth received the mother's randomized study drug. Infant blood samples were taken at birth and at several intervals during the first 24 months of life to determine the infants' HIV status by p24 antigen assays, plasma viremia, or HIV co-culture assays. An existing NICHD contract with Westat, Inc. was used to conduct the trial. Westat, the study coordinating center subcontracted to 25 NICHD clinical trial units. An approximately similar number of NIAID clinical trial units also participated in the trial. As of February 1, 1996, there were 51 clinical trial units participating. Data analysis was performed by Westat. In 1993, NHLBI contracted with North American Biologics to supply HIVIG.

Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is an accepted therapeutic option for many hematologic, immunologic, and malignant diseases, including chronic myelocytic leukemia and acute leukemia during or after first relapse (second remission). In order to maximize the chance for a successful transplant, it is desirable that the donor and the recipient share the same Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) histocompatibility antigens. Because of the Mendelian inheritance of HLA antigens, the chances of finding a match are much greater among relatives than in the general population. However, only about 30 percent of patients needing a transplant have a matched sibling. Thus a transplant from an HLA-matched unrelated donor may be an important alternative for these patients.

Graft versus host disease is a frequent and severe complication of marrow transplantation. Acute GvHD typically occurs within three months after transplantation and is characterized by skin rash, liver dysfunction, and diarrhea. Although the pathophysiology of this disease is not fully defined in humans, data from animal studies suggest that it is mediated by mature donor T cells that react against disparate recipient histocompatibility antigens.

One treatment modality that ameliorates or prevents GvHD following allogeneic marrow transplantation is T cell-depletion of donor marrow before infusion into the recipient. T cell-depletion can be divided into physical methods such as separation by elutriation or sheep cell rosetting, and immunologic methods which use a T cell-specific antibody(ies) plus complement or toxin to kill the cells. These different techniques may remove a subpopulation of T cells, all T cells, or T cells plus other cell types such as B cells or natural killer (NK) cells. The number of stem cells transferred may also be affected.

Unfortunately, in many of the published studies conducted in patients receiving transplants from HLA-matched siblings, T cell-depletion used to prevent or treat GvHD increased the chances of other complications, namely graft failure and leukemia relapse. This is not surprising in light of studies of patients with both early and advanced leukemias that demonstrated a decreased risk of relapse associated with acute and/or chronic GvHD. Because the net effect of these opposing consequences of T cell-depletion on leukemia-free survival in related donor transplants is generally unfavorable, T cell-depletion for related donor marrow transplantation is controversial. The utility of T-cell depletion in unrelated-donor transplants needs to be determined.

The initiative grew out of increasing concern on the part of Institute staff, the bone marrow transplantation community, and members of Congress that graft versus host disease is so frequent and severe a complication of unrelated donor transplants that it has become a limiting factor in their outcome. The initiative was given concept clearance by the May 1992 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council and released in January 1993.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The primary endpoint of this trial was disease free survival at three years post transplant. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, incidence of GvHD, graft failure, infections and other complications, and time to disease relapse. The covariates considered included age of recipient, disease risk status, interval between diagnosis and transplant, disease type, age and gender of donor, post-transplant chimerism, pre-transplant Karnofsky score, and other measures of performance status. An economic analysis was performed.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a T-cell depleted or a non-depleted transplant. Two methods of T-cell depletion were in use: an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, T10B9, plus complement, or counterflow elutriation plus the Ceprate column. Each method of T-depletion was part of a package that included a specific pre-transplant conditioning regimen and additional GvHD prophylaxis. Patients randomized to the non-T-cell depleted arm received a conditioning regimen containing cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, and a GvHD prophylaxis regimen of cyclosporin and methotrexate.

Stroke, occurring in about 10 percent of pediatric patients with sickle cell disease, is one of the most devastating complications, with a high recurrence rate after the first episode. Several non-randomized studies have shown reduction in stroke recurrence when periodic blood transfusions are administered to maintain hemoglobin S under 30 percent. Periodic blood transfusions are associated with significant risks of iron overload and other complications and must be accompanied by parenteral iron chelation therapy. However, this has become a standard of care for prevention of recurrent stroke in SS children. Thus, a randomized trial of blood transfusion for secondary prevention would not be feasible because it would be considered unethical. Based on various studies, the recurrence rate is reduced from 46 to 67 percent to approximately 7 percent on transfusion therapy. Because most stroke patients are left with some neurological deficit, and face a lifetime of disability, primary prevention would have a significant impact on the management of patients. However, because of complications of blood transfusions, the hypothesis should be proven by a randomized clinical trial.

A primary prevention trial had not been possible because an acceptable means of detecting those children at risk of stroke was not available. The advent of TCD to identify arterial abnormalities for the prediction of stroke has provided a means of detection. TCD abnormalities have a high specificity (100 percent) and high sensitivity (90 percent) for detecting angiographically proven narrowing of arterial diameter. Thus, TCD examination of the basal cerebral arteries is predictive of who will develop a stroke.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, Phase III, multicenter. Approximately 3,000 children from 12 clinics were screened with transcranial Doppler (TCD). A total of 130 were randomized to receive either standard supportive care or periodic blood transfusions if they were found to be at high risk of stroke on the basis of elevated cerebral blood flow as measured by TCD screening tests. Primary endpoints included clinically evident symptoms of cerebral infarction with consistent findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Secondary endpoints included asymptomatic brain lesions detected by MRI in brain areas not involved in primary endpoints.

Patients scheduled for transfusion were entered into the study at the time of their first transfusion and randomized to receive leukopoor red cells filtered within 24 hours of collection or unmanipulated blood components. Patients received blood as per their treatment arm as needed for one or two years. Patients were stratified to those with CD4 counts below 50 /MM3 (most patients) and those with CD4 counts above that level. Primary endpoints were overall survival and a change in HIV viremia after the 1st transfusion. The secondary endpoint was the occurrence of a new AIDS-defining complication. A substudy looked at donor lymphocytes in the immunosuppressed recipients to help determine why AIDS patients don't seem to get post-transfusion graft-vs-host disease. The patient recruitment time was extended for one year because of low accrual. With new drugs, especially protease inhibitors, the proportion of patients needing transfusion has decreased. The patients are less severely ill and their disease produces less anemia. Furthermore, the new drugs don't have anemia as a side effect. The trial ended in January, 2000.

The study should be contrasted with the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (CPPT), which determined whether lowering cholesterol through a combination of drug and diet therapy resulted in decreased cardiovascular mortality. It should be noted that patients in the CPPT did not have known preexisting coronary heart disease.

The prognosis of congenital or long-term anemia was formerly limited by the complications of blood transfusion, splenectomy, or infection, problems now largely overcome by sophisticated clinical care. Lifespan is now determined by the rate of myocardial iron deposition, with death occurring from cardiac failure or arrhythmia, usually between the ages of 15 and 25. Endocrine complications and hepatic enlargement are also evident by this age. Deferoxamine increases urinary iron excretion and is the only chelator currently available for chronic administration. Daily administration of deferoxamine results in negative iron balance in most patients by the age of 10; this study was designed to determine whether the onset of cardiac complications was delayed and life prolonged by iron removal.

This trial began in 1978. Its forerunner was a study involving both deferoxamine and ascorbic acid. Although ascorbic acid promotes iron removal, its administration was followed by cardiac deterioration in several patients. In this study, patients receiving subcutaneous deferoxamine were randomized to receive either ascorbic acid or placebo, thereby providing a controlled test of this agent in treatment of iron overload. Sixty-five patients with homozygous beta-thalassemia participated in the long-term chelation trial. Of these, 49 were randomized to the ascorbic acid trial.

Several noninvasive techniques have been developed to evaluate organ function in iron-overloaded patients, thereby facilitating the assessment of chelation therapy. These techniques included chest x-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and 24-hour Holter monitoring to assess cardiac function. Liver function was evaluated by standard liver function tests, CAT scan, and live biopsy. During the last six years of the study, hepatic iron stores were measured magnetically with a dual channel superconducting quantum-interference susceptomer. Endocrine function was also assessed by standard tests.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

All patients received subcutaneous deferoxamine and iron removal was determined by measurement of serum ferritin and periodic non-invasive measurements of liver iron concentration. Clinical status was evaluated by non-invasive testing of cardiac and endocrine function.

Also, to evaluate the use of intermittent, short-term, high-dose intravenous corticosteroids in patients with sarcoidosis. There were actually four separate clinical trials.","BACKGROUND:

The fibrotic lung diseases represent 15 to 20 percent of the non-infectious disorders of the lung. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, one of the 10 general groups of fibrotic lung disorders, is a chronic and devastating illness resulting in death within an average of 4 to 5 years from the onset of symptoms. Although 5 to 10 percent of these patients respond to corticosteroids, there is no known treatment for the remainder.

Sarcoidosis, a generalized disorder characterized by epithelioid cell granuloma formation in affected organs, especially the lung and lymphoid tissue, has a clinical course that varies considerably from patient to patient and, in some cases, resolves spontaneously. In other cases, intermittent pneumonitis develops, which may result in a permanent loss of lung function. Large intermittent doses of corticosteroids might be superior to conventional high-dose corticosteroids in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis which has not resolved spontaneously.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

In the randomized, non-blind cyclophosphamide versus prednisone trial, 25 to 50 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were assigned to treatment with prednisone or cyclophosphamide. At the end of 52 weeks of drug therapy, both groups were treated using conventional medical therapies. In the non-randomized dapsone trial, 10 fibrotic patients were treated with dapsone and prednisone for one year. In the double-blind, randomized methylprednisolone trial, 25 to 50 patients were given low-dose methylprednisolone, and, in addition, all patients were randomized to either high-dose methylprednisolone treatment or to placebo at weekly intervals for one year. In the randomized, double-blind, high-dose corticosteroid trial, 25 to 50 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis were given a short intense course of high-dose methylprednisolone or a placebo for 6 weeks.

The NCEP is a major public education program providing advice to physicians and the public on management and prevention of coronary heart disease. However, data supporting the advice are derived primarily from middle-aged men, with less data available for women and older individuals. Furthermore, there have been recent reports that when low saturated fat diets such as the NCEP Step One and NCEP Step Two diets, are followed, HDL-cholesterol is lowered as well as LDL-cholesterol.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, controlled, factorial design powered for men and women separately. One hundred eighty postmenopausal women, 45 through 64 years of age, and 197 men, 30 through 64 years of age, who had low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (< or =59 mg per deciliter in women and < or =44 mg per deciliter in men) and moderately elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (>125 mg per deciliter but <210 mg per deciliter in women and >125 mg per deciliter but <190 mg per deciliter in men) were enrolled. The subjects were randomly assigned to aerobic exercise, the NCEP Step 2 diet, or diet plus exercise, or to a control group, which received no intervention. The four interventions were delivered for one year: usual care (written dietary materials only with delayed intervention optional), exercise only (supervised, progressive aerobic exercise program at least three times per week), diet only (group and individual dietary instruction on the NCEP Step One/Step Two diet delivered by registered dietitians), and diet plus exercise. At baseline and at the end of one year, measurements were made of blood lipids and lipoproteins, plasma glucose and insulin, glucose tolerance, blood pressure, body composition through hydrostatic weighing and waist and hip circumterences, aerobic fitness (VO2 max), and five unannounced 24-hr. recalls.

Also, to determine possible correlations between lesion changes and plasma lipid and lipoprotein cholesterol levels and to explore interrelationships of atherosclerosis change in femoral, coronary, and carotid arteries.","BACKGROUND:

The Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial and the Coronary Drug Project had shown that morbidity and mortality from ischemic heart disease were reduced by blood cholesterol-lowering therapy. Although blood cholesterol reduction ameliorated experimental atherosclerosis in animal models, the two largest human studies with angiographic observation of arterial lesion change, the NHLBI Type II Coronary Intervention Study and a study by Cohn et al, had not demonstrated significant treatment effects. Favorable, but inconclusive, treatment trends were observed in four unrandomized angiographic trials and one trial too small for evaluation of randomized groups.

The clinical trial was supported by a subproject within a program project grant.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

CLAS-I was randomized and selectively-blinded. Screening for the trial consisted of five clinic visits, at which baseline data, including angiographic data, were obtained and a prerandomization trial of the study drugs was conducted. One hundred eighty-eighty subjects were randomized to either 30 grams (g) of colestipol hydrochloride plus 3 to 12 g of niacin daily or to placebo. Both groups received diet intervention. The drug group received less than 125 milligrams (mg) of cholesterol daily, 22 percent of energy as fat, 10 percent as polyunsaturated fat, and 4 percent as saturated fat. The placebo group received less than 250 mg of cholesterol per day, 26 percent of energy as fat, 10 percent as polyunsaturated fat, and 5 percent as saturated fat. The different diet composition for drug and placebo groups was to enhance the differential in blood cholesterol responses between the two groups. Study subjects and clinic staff were blinded to the prerandomization study drug trial lipid responses. Subjects were blinded to treatment assignments. Subjects and staff were not blinded to on-trial lipid values. The primary endpoint, the global change score, was change in atherosclerosis observed by angiography of native coronary arteries and aorta coronary bypass grafts. Evaluation of study end-points was performed by staff and consultants who were blinded to treatment group assignments, as well as to the temporal ordering of angiographic data. Subjects were seen monthly for the first six months and then at two-month intervals. A repeat angiogram was performed at two years. Of the 188 randomized subjects, 162 completed the study.

On completion of CLAS-I, participants not requiring further bypass surgery were invited to continue in CLAS-II for an additional two years on their previously assigned treatment. Blinded study methods were maintained; there was no crossover between treatments. One hundred thirty-eight subjects continued in CLAS-II; 103 completed a third angiogram before the CLAS-I outcome was known and CLAS-II terminated. The CLAS-II clinical procedures, lipid, lipoprotein-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein analyses were the same as in CLAS-I. The CLAS-II angiographic and file evaluation procedures exactly replicated those in CLAS-I.

Evidence from epidemiologic studies, and from one unpublished study, suggests that greater intake of antioxidant vitamins is associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Findings from an animal model indicate that increased intake of antioxidant vitamins prevents progression of aortic fatty streaks induced by an atherogenic diet, but not from more advanced injury-induced lesions. These observations suggest the hypothesis that increased antioxidant vitamin intake may prevent further progression of early atherosclerosis, possibly by means of reduced susceptibility of low density lipoprotein to oxidative modification and consequent cytotoxic, chemotactic, chemostatic, and unregulated uptake effects.

A new, automated, low-cost, portable ultrasound system for determining intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery makes it feasible to test the primary prevention impact of antioxidant vitamins on early atherosclerosis. Results of two studies at the University of Southern California suggest that the low-density lipoprotein effects on common carotid artery intima-media thickness can be detected by automated methods within 12 to 24 months in small patient samples. Retardation of intima-media thickness progression was achieved in both studies without significant changes in average vessel diameter, which suggests effects on early atherosclerotic lesions.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Patients will be screened for carotid intima-media thickness at home or at schools in mobile vans equipped with portable ultrasound equipment. After 12 months, those patients above the age and sex-adjusted 66th percentile at Screen I will be re-screened (Screen II), and those showing the greatest progression in intima-media thickness will be invited to participate in a trial run-in to assess vitamin E compliance. Patients will be randomized to the following four groups: 1) vitamin E (573 mg/day); 2) vitamin C; 3) Vitamin E and C combined; and 4) placebo. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness will be observed by ultrasound at 12- and 24-month follow-ups.

Unstable angina is a frequent diagnosis in post-menopausal women and is associated with a significant risk of myocardial infarction and need for revascularization. The pathogenesis of unstable angina involves vasoconstriction superimposed on fixed disease, causing a temporary decrease in coronary blood flow. Recent catheterization studies in patients with atherosclerosis utilizing quantitative angiography and intracoronary doppler measurements of blood flow velocity suggest that endothelial dysfunction results in a paradoxical coronary vasoconstriction response to certain neurohumoral stimuli including acetylcholine, catecholamines, and serotonin with resultant myocardial ischemia. Therapeutic agents which prevent or limit this vasoconstriction may prevent recurrent ischemia and/or myocardial infarction in unstable angina patients. Recently, estrogen receptors were identified in the smooth muscle of post-mortem human coronary arteries. Work in animal models and studies in post-menopausal women suggest that intravenous estrogen acutely decreases coronary vascular resistance, increases coronary blood flow, and prevents the paradoxical response to acetylcholine in patients with endothelial dysfunction.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial tested the hypothesis that intravenous estrogen followed by oral estrogen and the combination of intravenous and oral estrogen and progesterone in the routine management of unstable angina were beneficial compared with placebo in post-menopausal women. Subjects with rest angina and no contraindications to hormone therapy were randomized to receive intravenous followed by oral conjugated estrogen for 21 days, intravenous estrogen followed by oral conjugated estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone for 21 days or placebo. The primary end point was the number of ambulatory electrocardiographic ischemic events over the first 48 hours. Clinical events were also determined over six months of follow-up.

Sickle cell anemia is a complex syndrome with multiple organ system disturbances brought about by the interplay of genetic, humoral, vascular and environmental factors. The clinical course can be one of abrupt and insidious exacerbations and remissions, often migratory and repetitive. These events may result in impairment of function, permanently damaged organs, and ultimately death. Although there is wide variability in the clinical expression of sickle cell disease, this complex set of clinical manifestations is experienced by most patients. In addition, there is no evidence that the primary disease process is different in children when compared with adults with regard to painful episodes. However, children have a higher incidence of respiratory viral infections, and are susceptible to pneumococcal septicemia. With the successful completion of the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea (MSH) Trial in adults, attention has now been focused on the use of this agent in children.

The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) has demonstrated that sickle cell anemia patients with increased painful episode rates die at a younger age. In addition, increased levels of fetal hemoglobin are associated with improved survival, and is probably a reliable childhood forecaster of adult life expectancy. The beneficial effect produced by hydroxyurea is thought to occur because it increases fetal hemoglobin levels. Therefore, if chronic end organ damage can be prevented in early childhood by hydroxyurea administration, and if the crisis rate can be decreased by hydroxyurea use early in life, sickle cell anemia patients may experience increased longevity and an improved quality of life.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The Phase I-Phase II study, HUG-KIDS, examined the safety of hydroxyurea. Children with sickle cell anemia, age 5 to 15 years, were eligible for this multicenter Phase I/II trial. Hydroxyurea was started at 15 mg/kg/d and escalated to 30 mg/kg/d unless the patient experienced laboratory toxicity. Patients were monitored by 2-week visits to assess compliance, toxicity, clinical adverse events, growth parameters, and laboratory efficacy associated with hydroxyurea treatment. Eighty-four children were enrolled between December 1994 and March 1996. Sixty-eight children reached maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and 52 were treated at MTD for 1 year. The study was conducted at four Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers by the following investigators: Thomas R. Kinney at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina; Kwaku Ohene-Frempong at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia; Orah S. Platt at Children's Hospital in Boston; and Elliot Vichinsky at Children's Hospital in Oakland, California. The complete study lasted three years.

HLA typing was performed using DNA-base high resolution methods to determine HLA alleles. Patients with ""true"" HLA 3/6 and 4/6 matches were evaluated. In addition, a separate study in adults addressed the problem of limited cell dose and engraftment failure. The study was not planned as a randomized comparative clinical trial. Instead, it is a phase II/III efficacy study.","BACKGROUND:

Bone marrow transplantation is an effective therapy for a variety of genetic and hematologic disorders. Donated bone marrow, which provides a source of stem and progenitor cells for bone marrow reconstitution, is obtained either from related donors, usually HLA-matched siblings, or from HLA-matched unrelated donors. Because of the limited availability of HLA-matched related donors, HLA-matched unrelated donors are frequently the only alternative source of bone marrow for transplantation. To provide matched volunteer bone marrow donors for unrelated recipients, the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) was established in 1986 to develop a national Registry of HLA-typed individuals who agree to donate bone marrow if needed. More than 3 million potential marrow donors are now enrolled. A limitation of the registry approach is the time needed to identify a donor and complete the necessary clinical evaluation and laboratory testing for histocompatibility, infectious diseases, and general good health. Moreover, a certain proportion of potential donors change their minds or otherwise become unavailable between the time they enter the Registry and the time they are called as a preliminary match for a patient. Another disadvantage is the marrow harvesting procedure which requires the normal donor to be hospitalized and given general anesthesia in an operating room. Finally, the NMDP Registry consists of potential donors that are primarily of European Caucasian ancestry. Although great strides have been made in increasing the numbers of African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Americans, and Native Americans, it is still more difficult to find matches for these ethnic minorities than for Caucasian patients.

Human umbilical cord blood is an alternative source of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells capable of reconstituting the bone marrow of recipients with a variety of diseases. Cord blood stem and progenitor cells from related donors have been successfully transplanted world-wide in children with genetic or hematologic diseases. These results suggested that cord blood from unrelated, HLA-matched donors also can be used for patients who need a transplant but don't have a related donor. The existing problems in unrelated-donor bone marrow transplantation with donor recruitment, bone marrow harvesting, and matching for antigens peculiar to a particular ethnic group would be reduced if typed, tested, and frozen umbilical cord blood could be made easily and rapidly available. Such a system, which could complement or partially replace the present process, has been shown to be feasible. In an NHLBI-sponsored program, investigators have collected and cryopreserved a bank of about 9,000 human UCBUs. In addition, successful searches and matches (including many 4/6 antigen matches) have resulted in more than 900 unrelated-donor, UCBU transplants to date. Preliminary data from both these unrelated-donor and other related-donor cord blood transplants suggest that there is less GvHD than if the source of the graft were adult bone marrow. The severity of GvHD also seems less even in highly mismatched recipients. One important question is whether or not 3/6 HLA matched transplants in children will have acceptable 180-day disease free survival. It also remains to be determined if the graft-vs-leukemia effect is also less or if unrelated-donor cord blood grafts are as durable as those from matched, related-donors. Most transplants conducted thus far have been in children. Hence another important question is whether or not there are sufficient numbers of stem cells in cord blood to support transplantation to an unrelated adult.

The initiative was proposed by the Division of Blood Diseases and Resources staff and approved by the February 1995 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The Requests for Proposals were released in June 1995. Contracts were awarded September 30, 1997.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The study is multicenter, with six Cord Blood Transplant Centers (CBTCs), two collecting and storage centers (Cord Blood Banks -- CBBs) and one Coordinating Center. Each CBB used the same protocol for recruiting donors, collecting, processing, testing, storage, retrieval from storage, reprocessing from the frozen state, and shipping. Each participating CBTC used the same patient selection criteria, preparative regimen for patients in the same class, initial graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis, indications for the use of cytokines, definitions for events and complications, and methods for evaluating immune reconstitution. The main study evaluated the impact of HLA 3/6 and 4/6 matching on outcome. The primary endpoint was 180-day disease free survival after UCBU transplantation. Secondary endpoints included engraftment, the frequency and severity of acute and chronic GvHD with stratification by degree of HLA match, overall survival, and immunologic reconstitution. Data were collected on banked UCBUs to define unit quality by nucleated cell count and flow cytometry of surface markers to identify effects on patient outcome.

Coronary atherosclerosis is a major cause of death in women in the United States. Although coronary artery bypass surgery decreases symptomatic and clinical evidence of ischemia, it does not alter the underlying process. Patients may present several years later with recurrent symptoms that may be a result of occlusion of saphenous vein grafts, development of atherosclerotic disease in vein grafts, or progression of underlying disease. Any intervention that can reduce the rate of progression of coronary atherosclerosis following bypass surgery would provide significant benefit for women following bypass surgery and possibly for other women with atherosclerotic disease. Observational studies suggest that postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy is associated with a reduction in cardiac morbidity.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The study was a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Subjects were randomized to conjugated estrogen with daily medroxyprogesterone or placebo within two weeks of bypass surgery. Graft occlusion and development of vein graft atherosclerosis were measured by comparing quantitative coronary angiographic and vascular ultrasonic assessment of disease severity and extent performed at six months and three and a half years after randomization. The primary outcome variables included the occurrence of graft occlusion at six months and the change in severity and extent of atherosclerosis in the saphenous vein grafts over three years.

The trial, conducted in conjunction with a patient registry, is supported by the NHLBI, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).","BACKGROUND:

LVRS is intended primarily for those patients whose chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is predominantly emphysema. Emphysema is characterized anatomically ""by abnormal, persistent enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by the destruction of the airspace walls and without obvious fibrosis"". The loss of the lung architecture leads to compressible peripheral airways that close at higher than normal lung volumes (early airway closure). The increased compliance and the air trapping from early closure leads to hyperinflation of the lung, over distention of the chest wall, a flattened, disadvantaged diaphragm, and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. In the 1950s and 1960s, Dr. Otto Brantigan theorized that surgical excision of multiple wedges of lung would reduce lung volumes, thereby restoring the outward elastic pull on the small airways and reduce airway obstruction. Dr. Brantigan reported that the surgical excision of lung tissue resulted in significant clinical improvement in some cases, but mortality was high. With little objective data and high mortality, the procedure did not gain widespread acceptance.

The experience that diaphragmatic and chest wall function could be restored in emphysema with lung transplantation renewed interest in Dr. Brantigan's work. Improvements in surgical technique have opened the possibility of performing surgical excisions of lung tissue. Recent reports on LVRS have shown improvements in FEV1, FVC, TLC, RV and dyspnea and quality of life assessments.

These reports generated enormous excitement among patients and their doctors. Many centers around the country started performing LVRS with the result that hundreds of patients had the procedure, despite the preliminary nature of the results, the lack of rigorous patient selection criteria and the lack of information on long term outcome. Basic questions remain such as which patient should have the surgery, what protocol should be followed, what physiological tests should be obtained, and what is the long term efficacy of the technique on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The mechanisms of benefit and the full cardiopulmonary consequences are unknown.

The concept for the trial originated in the NHLBI Workshop on Evaluation and Research in Lung Volume Reduction Surgery. The initiative was reviewed and approved at the May 1996 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council meeting. The Requests for Proposals were released in June, 1996.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

In the trial, 1218 eligible patients were randomized to receive either medical therapy (610) or medical therapy with LVRS(608). LVRS was performed by median sternotomy or video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS). Centers randomized their patients to either a) medical therapy alone versus medical therapy with LVRS by median sternotomy, b) medical therapy alone versus medical therapy with LVRS by VATS, or c) medical therapy alone versus medical therapy with LVRS by median sternotomy versus medical therapy with LVRS by bilateral VATS. Medical therapy included pulmonary rehabilitation and education. Direct comparisons of the two surgical techniques were possible only at the centers that performed both techniques. All arms included intensive pulmonary rehabilitation. The primary endpoints were survival and functional improvement as assessed by maximum workload. Secondary endpoints included morbidity, improvement in pulmonary function, quality of life and performance of activities of daily living. Follow-up exams, including history, physical exams, pulmonary function tests, exercise tests and quality of life assessments, occurred after pre-operative rehabilitation and six and twelve months after surgery and every twelve months thereafter.

Mortality rates for heart failure are high, with five year survival rates approximating 30 to 40 percent in patients with mild to moderate symptoms and 0 to 20 percent survival in patients with severe symptoms. The patient with class IV heart failure has a one year survival rate of only 40 to 50 percent. This is despite advances in medical therapy and the availability of ACE inhibitors. While cardiac transplantation is the most viable form of treatment for these patients, it is limited by complications of chronic immunosuppression, the development of graft coronary artery disease and the serious shortage of donor organs. As many as 16,500 patients per year may be suitable candidates for heart transplantation. The actual number of donor hearts procured over the past few years, however, has remained relatively constant at 2,000. Thus, there is a strong rationale for the therapeutic application of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as an alternative to cardiac transplantation.

With respect to LVAD efficacy, patients have been supported for periods as long as 344 days on the pneumatic system and 503 days with the electromechanical device. Experience with the TCI pneumatic system in 75 LVAD patients show improved one year survival after transplantation in the LVAD patients as opposed to patients who did not receive the LVAD despite the same selection criteria. Experience with the vented electric LVADs in bridge patients show a transplant and survival rate that is similar to the pneumatic device. LVADs have also been shown to have a favorable effect on circulatory hemodynamics and exercise capacity. Among 53 patients who survived the TCI LVAD procedure, 90 percent improved to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I and 10 percent to functional class II.

With respect to safety, the principal adverse effects associated with the LVADs include bleeding, hemolysis, and organ dysfunction, thromboembolism, infection, right heart failure, and mechanical failure. Thromboembolic complications are low in the TCI device despite the lack of systemic anticoagulation. The overall mechanical failure rate is small, less than 1 percent in 26 patient years of use. The vented electric and pneumatic device experience to date indicates that the devices are similar with respect to adverse event rates. Thus, in 1997 there was a strong rationale for a randomized controlled trial that compared the benefits and cost of vented electric LVADs to medical treatment. The need to perform a randomized controlled study was further emphasized by the lack of rigorous data on survival, quality of life, and cost effectiveness comparing LVAD support with medical therapy.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Unblinded, randomized, multicenter. Patients were randomized to either the Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc. (TCI) vented electric (VE) LVAD or optimal medical therapy (OMM) and followed for at least two years. If randomized to LVAD therapy, patients received a LVAD implantation within 12 hours of randomization. If randomized to medical therapy, patients received optimal medical management including the use of digoxin, diuretics, and ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) inhibitors in maximally tolerated doses. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included cardiovascular mortality, exercise capacity (six-minute walk test) and health-related quality of life, adverse effects, and the relative cost-effectiveness of LVADs versus medical management.

DASH - Sodium built on and extended the results of the NHLBI-initiated Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study.","BACKGROUND:

High blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg, or taking antihypertensive medication, affects 24 percent of the United States adult population or about 50 million people. Because the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke increases with increasing blood pressure throughout the entire range of blood pressure levels, people with blood pressure above the optimal level of 120/80 are at increased risk of disease. Approximately 48 percent of the adult population have blood pressure either normal but above optimal levels or have Stage 1 hypertension, a prevalence which increases with age. To combat this highly prevalent condition, primary prevention through lifestyle modification represents a highly promising strategy for public health.

DASH - Sodium extended research from DASH trial to address several issues of relevance to clinical practice and public health and capitalized on the success of DASH by following the multicenter outpatient feeding study model. The model permitted a true test of efficacy because of high adherence and follow-up rates. In addition, the population studied across four geographic areas, encompassing individuals with diastolic blood pressure between 80-95 mm Hg and systolic blood pressure <160 mm Hg, was broadly representative, thus making the results generalizable to a large portion of the United States population.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The effects on blood pressure of three levels of sodium intake and two dietary patterns were compared. The combined impact of sodium reduction with dietary intervention was evaluated as a potential non-pharmacologic treatment alternative to drug therapy for stage one hypertension or for maintaining normal blood pressure levels. The two dietary patterns were a control diet that represented the typical American diet and an intervention diet (DASH diet) that was high in fruits, vegetables, included whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts, and reduced in fats, red meat, sweets, and sugar-containing beverages and dairy products. The three levels of sodium were higher (current United States intake), intermediate (current recommended levels), and lower (potentially optimal levels). Participants were assigned to one of the two dietary patterns using a parallel group design and were fed at each sodium level using a randomized cross-over design.

Three eligibility pre-screening visits were followed by a two-week run-in feeding period and then a four-week intervention period at each of three sodium levels. During the run-in for the intervention feeding periods, all food was provided to participants. They were required to attend the clinic for at least one meal per day, five days per week, and to take home food to eat for other meals. Each of the four clinics recruited 100 participants. Blood pressure was measured once a week during the first of three weeks and five times during the last week. During the final feeding period, fasting blood was collected and 24-hour urine collections were analyzed for magnesium, potassium. calcium, sodium, and creatinine.

DASH - Sodium determined, separately by race, gender, and hypertension status: 1) the effects on blood pressure of three levels of dietary sodium within the context of both a control diet and the DASH diet; 2) the effect on blood pressure of the DASH diet, relative to the control diet, at each of the three levels of sodium intake. The study also assessed whether the effect on blood pressure of going from higher to lower sodium diets differs for participants in the control and DASH diets. Lastly, the study determined whether the blood pressure effect associated with reducing sodium from the higher to the intermediate level differs from the blood pressure effect associated with reducing sodium from the intermediate to the lower level, that is, testing whether the blood pressure effects of sodium are linear across sodium levels for each diet.

Recruitment and screening began in August 1997. The first cohort began the experimental diets in January 1998 and the last cohort completed the diets in November 1999. A total of 412 participants were enrolled into the study. Results were presented at the annual meeting of American Society of Hypertension in May 2000.

The study was renewed under R01HL57114 to to analyze the data of the trial The hypothesis to be tested is that genetic makeup modulates the BP effects of DASH diet and reduced sodium intake through one or more of the following mechanisms: 1) effects on vascular tone; 2) effects on mineralocorticoid regulation of sodium homeostasis; and 3) effects on non-classical regulation of sodium homeostasis.",Interventional,"Healthy adult men and women, ages 22 and older, who had a diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 95 mm Hg and a systolic blood pressure less than 160 mm Hg.",No,All,22 Years,100 Years,

Congestive heart failure is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, and sudden arrhythmic death is the cause of death in from 30 to 50 percent of those who die. The study addresses the problem and tests two interventions that have promise of benefit. To date, many of the therapies that have been tested for congestive heart failure have either been ineffective or actually decreased survival. Conventional therapy is still relatively ineffective in that recent studies such as the Congestive Heart Failure - Survival Trial of Antiarrhythmic Therapy (CHF-STAT) have demonstrated a mortality of 40 percent during two-and-half years of follow-up. The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator appears to be effective in patients who are resuscitated from cardiac arrest, but until recently, the devices required a thoracotomy and had to be reserved for patients with the highest risk for sudden death. The newer transvenous devices with pectoral patches can now be considered for broader applications. Although there have been mixed results with amiodarone in patients with congestive heart failure, there is a general consensus that it could be effective in the proper subset of patients with congestive heart failure. A comparison of the optimal device and drug is appropriate for such a high risk population.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Three-armed, randomized, multicenter trial conducted at over 125 North American, Australian and New Zealand sites. Patients were enrolled over 2.5 years after being randomly assigned to amiodarone, matched placebo or an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD). Median follow-up was 45.5 months. All three arms used conventional therapy for heart failure and coronary artery disease (ACE inhibitors, lipid lowering and beta-blockers). The central hypothesis was that amiodarone or the ICD would improve survival compared to placebo. The primary outcome was the prevention of all-cause mortality. Secondary outcome measures included cardiac mortality and arrhythmic mortality, morbidity, quality of life, and incremental cost-effectiveness of the interventions.

The management of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) has improved dramatically over the last three decades. Advances in the general coronary care unit environment, treatment with beta blockers, and aggressive attempts at reperfusion have all contributed to a reduction in mortality from acute MI. Large randomized trials have demonstrated that aggressive reperfusion strategies in conjunction with aspirin can reduce mortality in patients with suspected acute MI to an average of 6.5 to 7.5 percent. However, the mortality rate remains high in two particular subgroups of patients: those who do not receive thrombolysis (11.5 to 13 percent) or those over 65 years who do receive thrombolytics (13.5 to 24 percent).

Recently, attention has turned to additional adjunctive pharmacologic treatment with agents such as magnesium, nitrates, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to determine their potential for reducing mortality further. Of these, magnesium appears to be particularly promising. It is safe, even in the hands of physicians who have no prior experience with it and it is easily administered and readily available in any hospital in the United States. Further, if it has the expected benefit in the high risk groups described, it would become an unusually cost-effective intervention, costing less than $2,500 per year of life saved.

Supplemental administration of magnesium very early after the onset of acute myocardial infarction is supported by abundant data indicating potential cardioprotective effects of magnesium. Magnesium is considered to be ""nature's physiologic calcium blocker."" This is because it protects myocytes against calcium overload by inhibiting calcium influx which is particularly important at the time of reperfusion. In experimental models of ischemia and reperfusion, agents inhibiting calcium influx improved post-ischemic recovery of mechanical function when given prior to or at the time of reperfusion. On the other hand, little improvement in mechanical function was observed if such agents were given 15-20 minutes after the onset of reperfusion. Reduced serum magnesium may also be responsible for a maladaptive increase in coronary tone and an increased response to vasoconstrictors.

In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, when increased serum magnesium might be beneficial, there is actually a decline in free magnesium. This comes about because of a sharp rise in free fatty acids brought about by catecholamine induced lipolysis at the onset of chest pain, that results in a completing of magnesium in the form of insoluble soaps. Thus, although total body magnesium does not decrease, magnesium available in a free form that is capable of exerting a cardioprotective effect declines. Hence, there is a strong theoretical rationale for supplemental magnesium administration in this setting.

Since 1984, at least 10 randomized control trials (RCTs) of intravenous magnesium for acute MI have been reported. Several statistical models exist for pooling the data from multiple RCTs in a meta-analysis and estimating the treatment effect of magnesium. It is important to review the essential features of these models in order to place the RCT findings in proper perspective. The fixed effects model assumes that the RCTs are sampled from a homogenous group of trials. Under the homogeneity assumption, each RCT provides an estimate of the true treatment effect and differences between the estimates from the various RCTs are due only to experimental error (within-trial variability). The random effects model assumes the RCTs are heterogeneous and that differences between their estimates of the treatment effect are due both to experimental error (within-trial variability) and real differences among the trials such as trial design and characteristics of the patients enrolled (between-trial variability). The random effects model is generally favored since heterogeneity that cannot be explained by experimental error often exists among the RCTs, and this model takes such heterogeneity into account in estimation and hypothesis testing. Meta-analyses of the seven RCTs published between 1984-199l provided an estimated odds ratio (OR) for mortality of magnesium treated patients of 0.44 (0.27-0.71) using the fixed effects model and 0.45 (0.23-0.86) using the random effects model. The Leicester Intravenous Magnesium Intervention Trial (LIMIT-2), published in 1992, reported a 24 percent reduction in mortality with magnesium treatment (P<0.04), confirming the benefit of magnesium in reducing mortality in MI and inspiring many clinicians to advocate magnesium treatment programs in their coronary care units. The magnesium treated patients in LIMIT-2 experienced a 25 percent lower incidence of congestive heart failure in the coronary care unit, suggesting that magnesium exerts its beneficial effects, at least in part, via a direct protective action on the myocardium. Given the potent predictive power of left ventricular function on survival following MI one would anticipate that magnesium-treated patients in LIMIT-2 would have a lower long-term mortality. This hypothesis appears to have been confirmed by the recent long-term follow up report from LIMIT-2 showing a 21percent lower rate of ischemic heart disease related mortality in the magnesium group over a median follow up of 2.7 years. The LIMIT-2 investigators have recently examined the mortality rates over a five year follow up, and continue to document the same long term benefit of magnesium administered in the acute phase of infarction. The absence of any loss of the mortality benefit of magnesium over the long term is consistent with a significant myocardial protective effect achieved during the critical period of myocardial reperfusion.

The results of ISIS-4 seemed to contradict the results of the above studies. A total of 58,043 patients were enrolled in ISIS-4, 29,009 allocated to magnesium and 29,034 to control. There were 2,196 deaths (7.6 percent) by 35 days in the magnesium group and 2,079 deaths (7.2 percent) in the control group (OR 1.06[0.99-1.13]) suggesting no mortality benefit of magnesium administration and even the possibility of slight harm. The findings of ISIS-4 have triggered considerable controversy over the reasons why it produced a null effect for magnesium in reducing mortality in suspected acute MI.

When ISIS-4 is added to the preceding eight RCTs, the fixed effects model (driven heavily by the large sample size of ISIS-4) indicates no beneficial effect of magnesium (OR= 1.02 [0.96-1.09]) while the random effects model that takes into account the heterogeneity among these trials suggests that magnesium may reduce mortality (OR= 0.69[0.47-1.02]). Thus, the random effects model suggests that one must search for possible sources of differences between ISIS-4 and the preceding trials. Two important differences that appear to be acting in concert to bias ISIS 4 towards a null effect of magnesium include:

1 . A low control group mortality rate. The control group mortality in ISIS-4 was only 7.2 percent. This was probably the result of the combination of extensive use of thrombolysis (70 percent of patients) and antiplatelet agents (94 percent of patients) combined with the enrollment of intrinsically low-risk patients (only 28 percent were over 70 years of age, 17 percent had a history of a prior MI, 14 percent had clinical congestive heart failure (CHF), and 2 percent had systolic blood pressure (SBP) <100 mm Hg). Incremental mortality reducing effects of magnesium are difficult to detect against a low background control mortality rate. The inability of ISIS 4 to detect any overall benefit of magnesium also apply to specific subgroups such as the 17,325 patients who did not receive thrombolytics. ISIS 4 had less than 60 percent power to detect even a 10 percent reduction observed in the 9.3 percent control mortality in this subgroup. A detailed analysis relating the mortality rate in the control group and the treatment effect of magnesium observed in the clinical trials published before ISIS-4 shows clearly that the benefit of magnesium therapy increases as the control group mortality increases. Using this relationship, it was predicted that trials with a control group mortality rate of about 7 percent would show no benefit of magnesium therapy, precisely the result observed in ISIS-4. Of note, the LIMIT-2 trial observed a control group mortality of 10.3 percent that was reduced to 7.8 percent with magnesium. The ISIS-4 control group mortality was thus below that of the magnesium treated group in LIMIT-2.

This analysis is consistent with the results of the latest RCT recently reported by Shechter and colleagues. They randomized 194 patients with acute MI considered unsuitable for thrombolysis to control (N=98) or intravenous magnesium (N=96). In addition to the standard contraindications to lytic therapy, reasons for exclusion from thrombolysis included either presentation after six hours and/or age greater than 70 years.

Shechter et al reported 17 deaths (17.3 percent) in the placebo group and 4 deaths (4.2 percent) in the magnesium group corresponding to an OR of 0.21 (0.07-0.64). Consistent with the hypothesis that magnesium helps reduce mortality by a direct myocardial protective effect are the data on the causes of death in this latest study. In the placebo group, 11 patients died from cardiogenic shock, 2 from electromechanical dissociation, 2 from myocardial rupture and 1 from cardiac arrest. In contrast, in the magnesium group 1 patient died from cardiogenic shock, 1 from myocardial rupture, and 2 from electromechanical dissociation. Particularly noteworthy are the findings in the subset of 77 patients over the age of 70, a group expected to have a high short-term mortality from acute MI. Indeed, 10 of the 44 elderly patients treated with placebo died (23 percent) while only 3 of the 33 elderly patients treated with magnesium died (9 percent,p=0.09). Also, in this especially high risk subgroup, the incidence of congestive heart failure was reduced from 25 percent in the placebo patients to 18 percent in the magnesium patients.

2. Magnesium was administered late in ISIS-4. The ISIS-4 protocol required that acute phase treatments for MI, including lytic therapy, were administered prior to randomization and initiation of study drug therapy (i.e. magnesium). By design, therefore, magnesium could not be administered in the ""early"" lytic phase (e.g. first hour). Although the time from onset of symptoms to randomization was recorded in ISIS-4, time from randomization to actual administration of magnesium was NOT recorded. The median time to randomization from the onset of chest pain for all patients was 8 hours; in the subset of patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy (30 percent of trial patients) the median time to randomization from onset of chest pain was QUITE prolonged at 12 hours.. No further details of the distribution of time to randomization have been reported by the ISIS-4 investigators. In an effort to answer these concerns, they conducted a retrospective survey of a 1,000 randomly selected patients. This revealed that among those receiving thrombolytics only about 50 percent received magnesium within the two hours following the start of thrombolytic therapy. LIMIT-2 randomized patients a median of 3 hours from the onset of chest pain, and in Schechter's study 19 of nonthrombolytic treated patients, the average time from chest pain to initiation of treatment was about seven hours in both the treatment and placebo groups (a full five hours earlier than in the non thrombolized group in ISIS-4) Attempts at subgroup analyses in ISIS-4 also suffer from a critical lack of precise information on the actual time of administration of magnesium. Thus although no apparent benefit of magnesium was seen in the 23,000 patients randomized within six hours of the onset of chest pain, or among the 17,000 who did not receive thrombolytic therapy (including 9,000 randomized within 12 hours), since most of these patients received magnesium several hours after randomization, one cannot be confident that reperfusion (pharmacologically induced or spontaneous) took place in the presence of a raised serum magnesium level in any subgroup. Experimental attempts aimed at ameliorating cellular calcium overload have shown that calcium antagonists must be administered before reperfusion or during a critical window of only a few minutes following reperfusion in order to minimize contractile dysfunction. Calcium flux inhibitors, such as magnesium, administered too late after reperfusion appear to be ineffective.

The same observations pertain to the subset of patients alluded to by the ISIS-4 Investigators who were randomized within six hours of symptoms onset and had a high multivariate prognosis score. In the absence of details on the timing of administration of magnesium, with particular reference to the elapsed time from onset of thrombolytic therapy, even in high risk subgroups, the findings of the ISIS-4 study remain compatible with the hypothesis that early administration of magnesium (particularly before reperfusion occurs) is associated with a reduction in mortality from acute myocardial infarction.

The implications of these observations are that, to prevent calcium overload of reperfused myocytes, a loading dose of magnesium should be administered before thrombolytic therapy and during the period when spontaneous reperfusion is most likely to occur in patients not receiving thrombolytics. The design of ISIS-4 did not permit these conditions to be met. Further, prior studies suggest that the low risk profile that characterized the ISIS-4 patients would have been likely to preclude obtaining much additional benefit. The results of the small trial reported by Schechter et al strongly support the view that high risk MI patients benefit from early treatment with magnesium infusion. However, definitive proof requires the larger sample size proposed in MAGIC.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The study was a randomised, double-blind trial in 6213 patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who were assigned a 2 g intravenous bolus of magnesium sulphate administered over 15 minutes, followed by a 17 g infusion of magnesium sulphate over 24 hours (n=3113), or matching placebo (n=3100). The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality. At randomisation, patients were stratified by their eligibility for reperfusion therapy. The first stratum included patients who were aged 65 years or older and eligible for reperfusion therapy, and the second stratum included patients of any age who were not eligible for reperfusion therapy. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. At 30 days, 475 (15.3%) patients in the magnesium group and 472 (15.2%) in the placebo group had died.. No benefit or harm of magnesium was observed in eight prespecified subgroup analyses of patients and in 15 additional exploratory subgroup analyses.

Prior to 1991, little research had focused on health issues unique to, or more common for, women. This was especially the case for studies of chronic diseases and their prevention in mature women. These conditions (coronary heart disease, cancer, and osteoporosis) are the leading causes of impairment of quality of life, morbidity, and mortality in post-menopausal United States women. The WHI, mandated by Congress, was established in 1991 by the National Institutes of Health and located in the Office of the Director (OD). The Clinical Coordinating Center for the clinical trial/observational study was funded in September 1992 and the 16 Vanguard Clinical Centers were funded in March 1993. The initial protocol was developed jointly by the Clinical Coordinating Center and the Program Office and was reviewed and approved by the Investigators Committee on April 20, 1993. Additional clinical centers were funded in 1994.

On October 1, 1997, administration of the WHI was transferred to the NHLBI where it is conducted as a consortium effort led by the NHLBI in cooperation with the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the National Institute on Aging (NIA).

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

As has been described in the objective, the WHI has three major components: a randomized controlled clinical trial, an observational study, and a study of community approaches to developing healthful behaviors. Recruitment for the WHI began in September 1993 and ended in December 1998. Six clinical centers completed recruitment in January 1997. The remaining 34 centers completed recruitment in December 1998.

CLINICAL TRIAL COMPONENT

The clinical trial component consists of three subtrials: the hormone replacement trial, the dietary modification trial, and the calcium /vitamin D supplementation trial. Approximately 27,500 women aged 50 to 79 are participating in the HRT, which tests whether long-term HRT reduces coronary heart disease and fractures without increasing breast cancer risk. Women with a uterus were randomized to receive either estrogen plus progestin or a placebo. Progestin was added to protect women with a uterus from endometrial cancer. Women who have had a hysterectomy were randomized to receive either estrogen alone or a placebo. The estrogen plus progestin trial was stopped early on July 8, 2002 after an average follow-up of 5.2 years on the recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. The estrogen alone study continued unchanged until March 2, 2004 when the NIH instructed participants to stop taking their study pills and to begin the follow-up phase of the study. . Participants in the estrogen alone study will be followed for eight to 12 years and have clinic visits every six months to assure safety and assess their health.

The dietary modification trial component studies the effect of a low-fat, high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on breast cancer, colorectal cancer and heart disease in 48,000 postmenopausal women. Participants are randomized to a comparison group which maintains usual dietary habits or to a dietary change group. Women in the dietary change group decrease their fat intake to 20 percent of total daily calories, increase fruit and vegetable consumption to five or more servings per day, and increase grains to six or more servings per day. Additionally, they monitor their food intake and attend nutrition group meetings to learn more about changing their diets in the first year. Thereafter they attend four meetings per year.

The calcium/vitamin D supplementation subtrial tests whether calcium and vitamin D supplements reduce the risk of hip and other fractures and colorectal cancer in postmenopausal women. Women in the hormone replacement therapy and the dietary modification trials are encouraged to join the calcium/vitamin D supplementation study. Approximately 45,000 postmenopausal women are randomized into one of two study groups. One group was randomly assigned to receive 1,000 mg of elemental calcium (as calcium carbonate) and 400 International Units of vitamin D₃daily. The second group received a matching placebo.

Women already taking calcium supplements can continue to take them. Participants will be followed for eight to 11 years and contacted by their clinical center every six months to assure their safety and assess their health.

Total number of trial participants in all three subtrials is 68,135.

OBSERVATIONAL STUDY

The several goals of the study include: to give reliable estimates of extent to which known risk factors predict heart disease, cancers, and fractures; to identify new risk factors for these and other diseases in women; to compare risk factors, presence of disease at the start of the study and new occurrences of disease during the WHI in all study components; and to create a future resource to identify biological indicators of disease, especially substances and factors found in blood. The study enrolled 93,726 postmenopausal women and will track them for an average of nine years. Participants fill out periodic health forms and visit the clinic three years after enrollment. They take no medication and do not change their health habits.

COMMUNITY PREVENTION STUDY

The community prevention study consists of 12 separate studies conducted at eight of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) University-based Prevention Research Centers through a cooperative agreement between NIH and CDC. The 12 studies began in October 1995 and continue for an additional five years. The collaboration supports health promotion and disease prevention research and demonstration projects that are community-based and focus on healthy behaviors that prevent the major causes of death and disability and that promote health practices that lead to more effective public health interventions. Each project provides research dissemination and translation of findings into community interventions. Topics under study include: attitudes towards hysterectomy, oophorectomy, and surgical menopause among African Americans; reducing cardiovascular disease risk among Black women; environmental and policy interventions to increase physical activity among minority women ages 40 to 75; peer support intervention for cardiovascular disease risk among African American women, aged 40 and older; assessing the effectiveness of a brief medical-provider educational intervention for osteoporosis in minority women aged 40 and older; improving the delivery of diabetes care to women in minority groups; and assessment of moderate physical activity among women.",Interventional,Postmenopausal women ages 50 to 79.,No,Female,50 Years,79 Years,

The results of many studies indicate that estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) reduces the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in postmenopausal women. However, less than 9 percent of these women choose to take ERT because of unwanted side effects and concerns about increased risk of cancer associated with ERT. Therefore, alternative therapies are needed.

The isoflavonoids found in soy protein (specifically genistein) have many properties that may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. These include favorable effects on plasma lipids and coronary artery vasomotion. Furthermore, genistein is a tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor with inhibitory effects on thrombin activity and TK receptor-linked mitogens that may be associated with atherogenesis and neointimal formation after angioplasty.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. The women were randomized into one of three groups: placebo, conjugated equine estrogens, or soy supplementation. Primary endpoints were the impact on menopausal complaints such as hot flushes, mood lability, anxiety, sleep disturbances; effects on plasma lipids and lipoproteins, including lipoprotein (a); effects on vaginal bleeding and endometrial proliferation; changes in health-related quality of life. Secondary endpoints included: assessment of the impact of these interventions on the progression of carotid artery intimal medial wall thickening as assessed by B-mode ultrasonography; bone density and bone turnover; additional measures to monitor the compliance and safety of the intervention such as mammography, anticipated or known side effects of hormone replacement therapy, blood levels of genistein, and clinical outcomes such as hospitalizations, physician visits, and symptoms. The study ended in December, 1998.

The study was a subproject within a program project on coronary atherosclerosis in females, primarily monkeys. Dr. Thomas B. Clarkson was the P.I. The subproject dollars were estimated based on the CRISP dollars assigned to the study which were approximately 12 percent of the total program project dollars and were broken down as follows: FY 1996 - 219,254; FY 1997 - $217,000; FY 1998 - $221,000.

Estrogen replacement therapy is beneficial for heart disease risk factors as well as for bone density. However, a large proportion of postmenopausal women are not compliant with therapeutic regimens. Phytoestrogens are naturally occurring compounds found in plants and soy products that have estrogenic effects, and may represent an alternative treatment for the prevention of heart disease and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. However, few intervention trials have examined the extent to which it is possible to improve heart disease risk factors, bone density, and quality of life in postmenopausal women through use of a dietary supplement of phytoestrogen.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 210 women were enrolled in the study to be followed for one to two years. The women were randomized to phytoestrogen treatment or to placebo. Data are collected at baseline visits, at one and three month follow-up telephone calls, and at 6, 12, and 24 month follow-up clinic visits. Measures of high density lipoprotein and other heart disease risk factors, hip and spine bone density, and depression, life satisfaction, and quality of well-being are obtained. Cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons of treatment and placebo groups are performed before and after adjustment and stratification for potentially confounding covariates.

The study was renewed in March 2002 to assess whether the women treated with phytoestrogens had lowered homocysteine, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, E-selectin, and decreased obesity and fat mass over two years.

Venous thromboembolism is associated with more than 300,000 hospitalizations and results in thousands of deaths annually. Conventional therapy consists of intravenous heparin followed by oral anticoagulants usually given for three to six months. The recommended intensity of oral anticoagulants (warfarin) has been derived from clinical trials. Such therapy is usually quite effective. However, some patients develop recurrent disease after the oral anticoagulants are stopped. A recent randomized study evaluated the optimal duration of oral anticoagulant therapy. After acute treatment with heparin, subjects were treated with oral anticoagulants for either six weeks or six months with a target INR * of 2 to 2.85. There was no difference in mortality in the two groups. Recurrence was not seen while the patients were under treatment. When anticoagulants were stopped, recurrent thrombosis was documented in 18 percent of the patients treated for six weeks and in 9.5 percent of those treated for six months. The period of greatest risk of recurrence for the six weeks patients was immediately after therapy was stopped. There was a linear increase in cumulative risk of 5 to 6 percent per year for both treatment groups during the following 18 months.

For patients who have experienced idiopathic venous thrombosis, the risk of recurrence may continue even after several months of conventional therapy. Further prophylactic therapy might be beneficial for the patients who are at risk for late recurrence. But, because of the presumed risk of bleeding and inconvenience of monitoring standard warfarin therapy, most physicians usually limit treatment to three to six months.

In 1997, Simioni showed a cumulative recurrence rate of VTE of 39.7 percent among those with factor V Leiden mutation, with all recurrences occurring within three years, a rate 2.4 times higher than among individuals without the mutation. The factor V Leiden mutation is found in 4 to 6 percent of Caucasians and is the single most important cause of thromboembolism in a variety of conditions. Heterozygous carriers with the mutation have VTE at a younger age than do noncarriers. Among those with first VTE, the prevalence of the mutation is 15 to 40 percent and among those with a family history of VTE, as high as 50 percent. However, in a large study of men participating in the Physicians Health Study, those individuals with the mutation had an increased rate of VTE over time. These age-specific incidence rate differences ranged from 1.23 to 5.97 in those aged 70 or older. These data suggest that confounders other than genetic predisposition are important in the development of VTE.

* The INR or international normalized ratio is the ratio of patient prothrombin to control prothrombin multiplied by the international sensitivity index. The INR was introduced by the World Health Organization to standardize control of anticoagulant therapy internationally.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. A total of 253 patients were randomized to usual care plus placebo and a total of 255 patients to usual care plus a three-to-four year regimen of low-dose warfarin (target INR 1.5 to 2.0), which after initial titration required infrequent outpatient monitoring. Double-blind INR assessment and dose adjustment were performed every three months to ensure patient safety and to monitor compliance. Primary endpoints included recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding episodes, and all-cause mortality. Separate analysis was performed of all-cause mortality in the total patient population and in those with factor V Leiden.

The high prevalence of obesity in Black women may be a contributing factor to their higher mortality from cardiovascular disease and higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension compared with white and Hispanic women. Although Hispanic women also exhibit high prevalence of obesity, mortality from heart disease is less than for Black or white women and mortality from diabetes is less than for Black women.

The increased prevalence of obesity in Black females is present during childhood, and the prevalence of obesity is increasing faster in Black girls than in white girls. Recent data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) showed that during preadolescence, age 6-11 years, 30.7 percent of Black girls, compared with 22.0 percent of white girls, were overweight. Furthermore, over the past 30 years the prevalence of obesity in this preadolescent age group has increased 150 percent in Black girls compared with 40 percent in white girls. The prevalence of obesity in the adolescent age of 12 to 17 years is similarly high, at 29.9 percent in Black girls compared with 20.7 percent in white girls. The 35 percent increase in obesity over the past 30 years is similar in the preadolescent and adolescent age groups for white girls, but for Black girls the increase is greater in the younger age group (150 percent more prevalent) than in the older age group (80 percent increase) .

The Special Emphasis Panel (SEP) on Intervention Studies in Children and Adolescents to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease was convened in September 1997 to review the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions to prevent and improve known cardiovascular disease risk factors in children and adolescents and to develop recommendations for future preventive intervention studies. The initiative was developed in response to recommendations of the SEP. The RFA was released in April 1998.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The Girl's health Enrichment Multi-site Studies (GEMS) is a collection of studies designed to develop and test interventions to prevent excessive weight gain by African-American girls as they enter and proceed through puberty. The research is being conducted as four inter-dependent, clinical trials. They are ""inter-dependent"" in the sense that they are considering similar study populations, following similar follow-up schedules and use a ""core"" set of evaluation procedures. Nonetheless, GEMS is not a ""multi-center clinical trial"" in the usual sense - each field center is evaluating its own intervention (and corresponding control). As a result, each study will have high internal validity and will be designed and analyzed as a study in its own right.

In Phase I, several distinct and separate interventions were developed. Interventions addressed diet, physical activity, and psychosocial and familial influences. There were four participating centers in Phase I, including the University of Memphis, Stanford University, the University of Minnesota, and Baylor College of Medicine. The coordinating center was located at George Washington University.

In Phase II, individual clinical trials will be supported to test the efficacy of interventions developed in Phase I. Although the interventions developed by each field center will be unique, the centers will collaborate to standardize key measurements, outcomes, and main analysis methods. The Memphis Field Center will conduct a full-scale two year, randomized, controlled clinical trial for weight gain prevention among 300 high risk, preadolescent African American girls and their parents. Body mass index is the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include dietary intake, physical activity, and psychosocial variables. The Stanford Field Center will conduct a two-arm parallel group, randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of an after school dance program and a family-based intervention to reduce television, videotape, and video game use to reduce weight gain among 260 African American preadolescent girls. An active placebo group will receive an information-based community health education intervention. Interventions will last for two years.

A large body of data has been collected over the years documenting that on the one hand, reduced sodium intake, increased physical activity, weight loss, and moderate alcohol ingestion (Comprehensive Intervention) have been associated with a modest reduction of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in with high normal and Stage 1 hypertension. On the other hand, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study has shown that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and decreased saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol (DASH intervention) reduced both diastolic and systolic blood pressure in similar baseline blood pressure groups.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

A multicenter study to determine the BP-lowering effects of two multi-component lifestyle intervention programs compared with advice only. Eight hundred and ten men and women were randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms: (A) advice only; (B) comprehensive lifestyle intervention, in which participants received an intensive behavioral intervention program to facilitate achieving current lifestyle recommendations for BP control (reduced salt intake, increased physical activity, reduced alcohol intake, and weight control or weight loss if needed); and (C) comprehensive lifestyle intervention plus the DASH diet, in which participants received a behavioral intervention program to promote the DASH dietary pattern in addition to the same lifestyle recommendations for BP control. Participants were followed for 18 months. The primary outcome variable was systolic blood pressure measured at six and 18 months after randomization. Other variables included diastolic blood pressure, dietary adherence, physical activity, and onset of hypertension over the 18 months of follow-up.

Cumulative evidence from past studies supports but does not prove a causal association between Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and development or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Evidence supporting an association raises the question of whether a causal effect of Chlamydia pneumonia infection, if present, may be ameliorated by antibiotic treatment, resulting in decreased CHD outcomes. The ACES is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine whether treatment with azithromycin decreases the rate of coronary heart disease events among patients with stable documented coronary artery disease.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

A randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial of azithromycin versus placebo among adults with documented prevalent coronary artery disease. Patients were enrolled over an 18-month period from a total of 28 centers. Following enrollment, an electrocardiogram was obtained, and patients with a prolonged QT interval were excluded. Eligible patients were then randomized to receive either placebo or azithromycin 600 milligrams orally once a week for a year. At the time of enrollment, a blood sample was obtained for C. pneumoniae antibody testing. Patients were contacted at one, three, and six weeks, and at three, six, nine, and twelve months. The patients were followed for a mean of four years for the composite primary outcome of coronary heart disease death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, and requirement for coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous revascularization. After the first year of the study, each patient was contacted every six months to determine the occurrence of outcomes. In addition, when available, computerized hospitalization and outpatient data were reviewed. Outcome events were classified using standardized algorithms. The relationship of antibody titer at baseline to the efficacy of azithromycin and outcome was a secondary analysis. The primary analysis was according to the intent-to-treat principle.

In addition to the therapeutic trial a serologic follow-up substudy was conducted on 25 percent of patients enrolled in the therapeutic trial. The subset of patients were randomized to obtain blood samples at three and six months, one and two years, and at the end of the study for serologies. The purpose of the substudy was to determine the effect of azithromycin on serologic titers to C. pneumoniae and to evaluate whether the occurrence of coronary heart disease events is associated with a change in antibody titer.

Protocol planning will take place for the first six months of the trial, followed by one and a half years of patient enrollment. Patient followup continues for three years after the recruitment period and the final six months will be a close out and analysis phase.

A secondary objective was to determine costs and resource utilization of PAC-directed treatment strategy compared to non-invasive treatment strategy.","BACKGROUND:

Congestive heart failure constitutes one of the major categories of morbidity, particularly in the elderly, and is responsible for the utilization of significant resources, including a large number of hospitalizations (estimated at 800,000 to 2.3 million per year) and related health care costs. In 1993, 4.7 million Americans carried the diagnosis of CHF, and about 400,000 new cases are diagnosed every year. It is estimated that there are 800,000 to 1.2 million CHF patients with NYHA class III-IV symptoms. The diagnosis and treatment of CHF and its episodes of decompensation can be facilitated by pulmonary artery catheter use, but its efficacy is highly dependent on the physician's experience in the treatment of such patients. Recently, concern has been raised about the benefits of PAC, also known as Swan-Ganz catheterization.

In response to concerns about the benefits and safety of PAC, the NHLBI and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) co-sponsored a workshop in August 1997 entitiled ""Pulmonary Artery Catheterization and Clinical Outcomes (PACCO)"". The purpose of the workshop was to provide an objective assessment of the state-of-the-science of PAC and its various uses. Experts in critical care, pulmonary medicine, cardiovascular medicine, surgery, pediatric cardiology, nursing, biostatistics, ethics, and medical economics identified several important clinical areas as priorities for clinical trials; persistent/refractory congestive heart failure (NYHA class IV) received top priority to test whether a PAC-directed treatment strategy achieves a better and less costly long-term outcome compared to a non-invasive treatment strategy. In addition to providing data on outcome, hospital utilization, and costs, the study would have additional benefits. For example, it would provide a clear benchmark for testing other technologies, now in developmental stages, that could supplant PAC in the future. Finally, the study would provide the basis for developing competency requirements for physicians, nurses, and others who insert and use pulmonary artery catheters, which was a strong recommendation of the PACCO Workshop.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

Patients were randomized into two treatment arms: A total of 218 patients were assigned into a treatment strategy without PAC hemodynamic monitoring (Usual Group) and 215 patients into a treatment strategy guided by PAC (Hemodynamic Group). The primary endpoint was the combined endpoint of rehospitalization and death.

For all patients randomized, therapy was tailored to the ultimate goal of discharge on an oral medical regimen to provide better relief of CHF symptoms, to reduce filling pressures and to maintain adequate perfusion. These goals were the same for both groups, but in the Usual Group therapy was adjusted according to clinical assessment alone, while in the PAC-directed group, actual measurement of hemodynamics was used to supplement clinical assessment. The oral medical regimen for discharge was designed by the attending heart failure physician based on the standard available medications of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), nitrates, hydralazine, furosemide and other diuretic agents. Intravenous diuretics were used when major diuresis was desired with subsequent change to oral diuretics at least 48 hours before discharge. Physicians could also use low dose infusions of dopamine or dobutamine to facilitate diuresis. Intravenous nitroprusside could be used in either group.

In the Usual Group, therapy was tailored to the following goals: a) absence of evidence of elevated intracardiac filling pressures; relief of orthopnea; relief of abdominal discomfort attributed to hepatosplenchnic congestion; resolution of peripheral edema, ascites, and rales; reduction of jugular venous distension to 5 cm or less above sternal angle; and b) adequate peripheral perfusion; warm extremities, if they could be achieved, and pulse pressure 25 percent or more , or, if less, the greatest which could be achieved. Either during or after hemodynamic monitoring, therapy could be adjusted to achieve the clinical goals above and further adjusted, if necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure and renal function for all patients. Patients for whom therapy was adjusted without hemodynamic monitoring could crossover for hemodynamic monitoring at any time they reached certain criteria. The criteria for crossover included: need to add intravenous inotropic agents above 3 mcg/kg/minute to prevent symptomatic hypotension; repeated inability to discontinue low-dose inotropic agents; or renal insufficiency.

In the PAC-directed hemodynamic arm, therapy was adjusted to achieve specific hemodynamic goals in addition to the clinical goals in the Usual Group. These goals could include: pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) 15 mm Hg or less; right atrial pressure 8mm Hg or less unless PCWP is 15 mm Hg or less; maintenance of systolic blood pressure of 80 or above, except for occasional transient decreases to lower levels after oral medications.

Regardless of the goals by which therapy was adjusted in the hospital, the following conditions were met prior to discharge: 24 hours on oral medications alone without major medication change except for anticoagulation, and 48 hours after discontinuation of any intravenous inotropic medications; stable fluid balance; patient education; and home services and follow-up appointment.

Post-discharge management was the same for both groups, according to standard practice. Patients were followed for adjustment of CHF medications in their heart failure clinics at one to two weeks, four weeks, three months, and six months and more often if clinically indicated. There was a minimum of six months of follow-up.

Data collection included: blood pressure and weight at each visit; electrocardiogram at pre-randomization visit and at each hospitalization; serum electrolytes; echocardiogram at randomization, at hospitalization discharge, and at six month follow-up; exercise stress tests during index hospitalization and six month follow-up; natriuretic hormone profile at randomization, discharge, and six month follow-up; medical history, endpoints, side effects, hospitalizations and quality of life; and compliance with protocol.

The study consisted of a Clinical Coordinating Center which included a network of 26 clinical units, and an echocardiographic core laboratory. The Protocol developed extended for six months, patient recruitment extended for 48 months, follow-up for six months, and data analysis for six months.

Currently, about 17 million Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes and more than 90 percent of them have type 2 diabetes. The number of people with this form of diabetes, formerly known as adult onset or non-insulin dependent diabetes, is growing rapidly. By 2050, the number of Americans with diagnosed diabetes is projected to increase by 165 percent to 29 million, of whom 27 million will have the type 2 form. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in people with type 2 diabetes; these individuals die of CVD at rates two to four times higher than those who do not have diabetes. They also experience more nonfatal heart attacks and strokes.

Type 2 diabetes is associated with older age and is more common in those who are overweight or obese and have a family history of diabetes. Women with a history of diabetes during pregnancy, adults with impaired glucose tolerance, people with a sedentary lifestyle, and members of a minority race/ethnicity are also at a greater risk for developing type 2 diabetes. African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, American Indians, and some Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are at particularly high risk for type 2 diabetes.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The three strategies tested in ACCORD included the following: (1) Blood sugar - ACCORD was designed to determine whether lowering blood glucose to a level closer to normal than called for in current guidelines reduces CVD risk. The study estimated effects on CVD of that level compared with a level that is usually targeted. (2) Blood pressure - many people with type 2 diabetes have high blood pressure. The blood pressure part of the trial was designed to determine the effects of lowering blood pressure in the context of good blood sugar control, that is to determine whether lowering blood pressure to normal (systolic pressure less than 120 mm Hg) will better reduce CVD risk, as compared to a usually-targeted level in current clinical practice (i.e., below the definition of hypertension; systolic pressure less than 140 mm Hg). (3) Blood Fats - Many people with diabetes have high levels of LDL (""bad"") cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as low levels of HDL (""good"") cholesterol. ACCORD participants who are selected for this part of the trial were assigned to an intervention to improve blood fat levels. This part of the study looked at the effects of lowering LDL cholesterol and blood triglycerides and increasing HDL cholesterol compared to an intervention that only lowers LDL cholesterol, all in the context of good blood sugar control. A drug from a class of drugs called ""fibrates"" was used to lower triglycerides and increase HDL cholesterol, whereas a drug from the class of drugs called ""statins"" was used to lower LDL cholesterol.

All ACCORD participants received blood sugar treatment from the study. Based on the second trial (Blood Pressure or Lipid) they were assigned to, participants also received their high blood pressure or cholesterol care from the study. Study participants received all medication and treatments related to the study free of charge. Individuals who selected for and consented to participate in the ACCORD study continued to see their personal physician for all other health care.

In summary, the ACCORD Study was a double 2x2 factorial design with factors consisting of: intensive versus standard glycemic control, intensive versus standard blood pressure control, and blinded fenofibrate or placebo in combination with simvastatin to maintain desirable LDL-C levels. All 10,251 participants were randomized to the glycemic interventions; a subgroup of 4,733 participants who met the blood pressure entry criteria were randomized to the blood pressure interventions in one 2x2 trial; and a distinct subgroup of 5,518 participants who met the lipid entry criteria were randomized to the lipid interventions in the second 2x2 trial. All participants had established type 2 diabetes and were recruited from 77 clinical centers in the United States (64 sites) and Canada (13 sites).

On February 6, 2008, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) announced that participants in the intensive glycemia treatment would be transitioned to the ACCORD standard glycemic treatment approach due to higher mortality in the intensive treatment group terminating the experimental arm of the Glycemia Trial early. The Blood Pressure and Lipid trials continued as designed to their planned termination in 2009.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria:

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema, affects more than 16 million Americans, is the fourth leading cause of death in the USA, and costs the nation billions in direct and indirect health care costs. Though only about two million of the 16 million people with COPD have emphysema, emphysema is more disabling, accounting for approximately half of the 114 million days of restricted activity and half of the 53 million days of disability attributed to COPD per year. Emphysema is characterized by destruction of the air space walls, leading anatomically to abnormal, persistent enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, and without obvious fibrosis. The clinical result is continuous dyspnea due to hyperinflation of the lung, over distention of the chest wall, disadvantaged respiratory muscles, and hypoxia, even at rest.

Treatment options in emphysema are limited and primarily aimed at symptomatic relief of the dyspnea by maximizing the depleted reserves of the patient. In the late stages, care is supportive, in the form of oxygen therapy, bronchodilator, nutritional supplementation and exercise rehabilitation. Exercise rehabilitation has been shown to improve the quality of life, but only oxygen therapy has been shown to affect survival. For patients less than 60 years old, lung transplantation may be possible, but scarcity of donor lungs and expense greatly limits this option and the efficacy has not been studied. Lung volume reduction surgery is currently under investigation for its effect on symptoms and survival. For the few patients with hereditary alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, the recent report of the NHLBI supported Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency Registry Study Group cautions that although those with moderate airflow obstruction may benefit from augmentation therapy, more studies were needed to draw firm conclusions and to answer questions about dose and dosing schedules.

Recent laboratory data have shown that all-trans-retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A, can regenerate alveoli in adult rats with elastase induced emphysema (Massaro, GD and Massaro D. Retinoic Acid Treatment Abrogates Elastase-induced Pulmonary Emphysema in Rats. Nature Med 3:675-677, 1997). Based upon the findings that prior to septation, rats have fibroblasts rich in vitamin A storage granules, high concentrations of cellular retinol binding protein, and lung nuclear retinoic acid binding receptors, all of which diminish after septation and the fact that retinoic acid increases the number of alveoli in rats, the investigators reasoned that retinoic acid plays a key role in septation. Tracheal instillation of elastase into adult rats resulted in an increase in lung volume, a decrease in surface area, and large alveoli as in human emphysema. Intra peritoneal injection of all-trans retinoic acid in the elastase-treated rats for 12 days prior to sacrifice reduced the lung volume and increased the surface area to normal.

In addition to the elastase-treated rats, all trans-retinoic acid has been found to induce formation of alveoli in normal rats, in neonatal rats treated with dexamethasone, which prevents septation, in adult tight skin mice, and in fetal mouse lung in culture.

These findings led to interest in the medical community whether adult emphysema patients might get symptomatic relief from treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid. In September 1998, the NHLBI convened a workshop, entitled ""Clinical Trial Feasibility: All-trans-Retinoic Acid for the Treatment of Emphysema"", to discuss the feasibility of a clinical trial to test the efficacy of retinoic acid in the treatment of emphysema. The workshop participants agreed that the laboratory findings were exciting, but that a proof of principle study was needed to demonstrate whether the laboratory findings could be applied to humans with emphysema. Since there was adequate information about the dose range and toxicity of retinoids in humans, adequate methods for assessing the extent of emphysema, and adequate methods to assess the biological activity and distribution of retinoids in the human lung, the workshop participants thought studies in emphysema patients were possible and appropriate. Several possible populations and retinoids, especially the retinoic acids, were discussed as appropriate for a clinical trial. However, the participants did not think that there was sufficient information available to recommend a single trial design and recommended the conduct of multiple small trials, allowing flexibility in the choice of population, retinoid, doses, and outcomes.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The core study is a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolling a total of 300 non-smoking persons with emphysema at 5 participating clinical centers. Study participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three retinoid treatment arms. Within each study arm, participants were randomized to active treatment or to a matched placebo in a 3:1 ratio. After six months of follow-up, the three month crossover period began. Participants initially assigned to active treatment began taking the matched placebo, and participants originally assigned placebo began taking the active treatment. Retinoid treatment arms were all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA trademark, Roche Laboratories, Inc.) at two different doses and 13-cis retinoic acid (cRA, Roche Laboratories, Inc.), each with matched placebo.

The emphasis will be on clinical trials that help identify optimal therapy. Therapeutic trials may involve investigational drugs, drugs already approved but not currently used, and drugs currently used.","BACKGROUND:

Cooley's anemia (beta-thalassemia major, hereafter referred to as thalassemia) is a severe, inherited blood disorder characterized by a quantitative defect in the synthesis of the beta chain of hemoglobin caused by any 1 of more than 100 known mutations in and around the beta globin gene cluster. The disease is characterized by severe anemia beginning in the first 6 to 12 months of life. If untreated, the life expectancy is less than 5 years of age. Chronic red blood cell transfusions to maintain hemoglobin levels between 9 and 11 gm/dl (""hypertransfusion"") alleviate the anemia and partially suppress erythropoiesis. The regular administration of red blood cells also improves growth, delays or prevents enlargement of the liver and spleen, and prevents the development of bone abnormalities that cause fractures as well as disfiguring changes known as Cooley's facies. Transfusions carry risks of alloimmunization, iron overload, and blood-transmitted infections. In the absence of effective iron chelation therapy, iron overload leads to numerous complications, including delayed or absent sexual development, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, cardiac arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure. Nonchelated or poorly chelated patients usually die of heart disease by 20 to 30 years of age.

The addition of chelation therapy with deferoxamine (DFO) to the treatment of Cooley's anemia has dramatically improved the outcome for affected patients. With regular chelation therapy, the accumulation of excessive iron can be prevented. Studies have demonstrated that well-chelated patients have normal or only modest increases in liver iron, improved growth, sexual development, and most importantly, a markedly reduced chance of developing iron-induced heart disease.

In the past few years, several new approaches to the treatment of thalassemia have included marrow or stem cell transplantation; the use of young red blood cells (""neocytes"") for transfusion; maintenance of a higher pretransfusion hemoglobin level; new iron chelators; and the use of drugs such as hydroxyurea, erythropoietin, and butyrate compounds.

It is recognized that even with a clinical network, the number of patients with Cooley's anemia who can be enrolled in a research protocol is likely to be small. Therefore, although a randomized clinical trial may be the preferred way of assessing the clinical benefits of a new therapy, it may not be feasible in some instances, even using biomarkers or other surrogate outcome measures. Depending upon the specific questions being addressed, other study designs might be appropriate. These might include pre- and post-treatment assessment or historical control studies. In all cases, the proposed design, including sample size, would be evaluated by the Protocol Review Committee.

There is an urgent need to evaluate new and existing therapeutic approaches for persons with thalassemia and to disseminate the findings to health care professionals, patients, and the public. There are several reasons why a thalassemia clinical research network will accelerate clinical research and meet this need. The highly variable and sometimes complicated clinical manifestations of thalassemia often make it difficult to accumulate a large number of comparable patients in one center. Furthermore, uniformity in treatment protocols may reduce the number of patients needed at each clinical center. Also, the TCRN mechanism will help pool the necessary clinical expertise and administrative resources to facilitate the conduct of multiple and novel therapeutic trials in a timely, efficient manner. This, in turn, would promote rapid dissemination of research findings to health care professionals.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The network was originally funded in 2000 and has been extended through June 2010 to perform interventional clinical trials in key areas of thalassemia care. Two major trials are proposed: First, a randomized, controlled trial to examine the effect of DFO alone versus DFO plus deferiprone on cardiac disease due to transfusional iron overload; second, a randomized trial of arginine versus sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension, an important problem in thalassemia intermedia and other hemolytic states. Goals are to provide an infrastructure for development, launch, and prompt completion of small, innovative trials in thalassemia and to improve assessment of phenotype and clinical outcomes in thalassemia to facilitate current and future clinical trials. This will be accomplished by two studies: The Thalassemia Longitudinal Cohort (TLC) study and the Iron Burden Study, which is a detailed study of iron-related organ damage comparing measures of iron burden in the heart, liver, and pancreas to outcomes of iron-related organ dysfunction. Combined with the clinical trials and the ability to perform detailed genotype/phenotype correlations, these improved phenotype and outcome measures are powerful tools to enhance knowledge about thalassemia clinical care.

To determine the peak and trough blood levels of FIAU and its metabolites during two weeks of oral dosing with FIAU.

The pyrimidine nucleoside analog FIAC and its primary deaminated uracil metabolite FIAU are highly and specifically active compounds in vitro against several herpes group viruses, particularly herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, varicella zoster (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV), as well as hepatitis B virus (HBV). Since FIAU is the primary metabolite of FIAC and the administration of FIAU simplifies the metabolism of FIAC, it is anticipated from clinical studies of FIAC that FIAU will be tolerated at least as well as FIAC. A single-dose, pharmacokinetic (blood level) study showed that FIAC, when taken orally, is readily absorbed into the bloodstream, and most of it is converted to FIAU. Daily oral doses are expected to provide concentrations of FIAU exceeding the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration for nearly all the herpes group viruses.","The pyrimidine nucleoside analog FIAC and its primary deaminated uracil metabolite FIAU are highly and specifically active compounds in vitro against several herpes group viruses, particularly herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, varicella zoster (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV), as well as hepatitis B virus (HBV).

HIV-infected patients with Karnofsky scores at least 80 (with or without documented recurrent herpes group infections) are successively entered into consecutively studied, escalating dose cohorts. There are a total of 4 dose cohorts of FIAU and each patient takes the required amount of FIAU syrup every 8 hours, 1 hour prior to or 3 hours after meals, for a total of 14 days. Entry of new patients at the next higher dose is based on results of tolerance and safety data for prior cohort when all 10 have received 14 days of therapy and at least 7 have met all of the tolerance criteria. Although not formally randomized due to the sequential nature of the study and serious medical condition of the patients, every attempt to avoid bias in assigning a patient to a dose is made. Patients are entered starting with the first dose cohort. Upon meeting the enrollment and tolerance criteria for dose escalation, up to 5 patients with a history of chronic HBV infection and surface antigen positive at their screening visit are added to the end of each dose cohort. Plasma samples are taken to determine peak and trough levels of FIAU at Days 1, 3, 7, and 14 or at last visit. Patients with ongoing active infections are followed by culture (HSV, VZV and CMV) or test (HBV) at Days 1, 3, 7, and 14.

Recombinant soluble CD4 (rCD4) has shown antiretroviral effects and has been shown to be safe when given to AIDS and ARC patients either as a single agent or in combination with AZT.

Part 1A: Twenty p24+ patients with AIDS or advanced ARC are randomized to 4 dosing groups of 5 patients each. Patients are treated with AZT for 6 weeks at ranging doses to determine a minimally effective dose (MED). At the end of week 6, each patient is sequentially assigned to 1 of 5 groups of rCD4 / AZT combination treatment. The first 3 patients to complete treatment through week 6 are treated in group A, the next 3 patients in group B, and so on. The treatment period is 4 weeks. Each patient continues on his or her AZT dose as initially administered. The highest dose of AZT that produces less than a 50 percent drop in HIV-1 p24 antigen levels in at least 3 of 5 patients over 6 weeks will be the MED of AZT and will be known as the AZT MED. After the MED is determined, Part 1B begins.

A secondary objective is to obtain preliminary data for determining the effect of oral VP-16 on Kaposi's sarcoma.

VP-16 is an antitumor agent. Previous problems with VP-16 include the route of administration and the toxicities. VP-16 has been given intravenously for 3 consecutive days in a 21-day cycle for lung cancer and testicular cancer. VP-16 has also been used in lymphoma therapy. Oral VP-16 would eliminate the need for an intravenous catheter and so a patient could avoid the pain, inconvenience, and potential complications associated with medications administered intravenously. The relative ease of outpatient administration and the potentially significant antitumor activity of oral VP-16 motivates this study. The possibility of weekly drug administration is the other focus of this study.","VP-16 is an antitumor agent. Previous problems with VP-16 include the route of administration and the toxicities.

Although none of these responses has been shown to be protective, it is possible that boosting anti-HIV immune responses through immunization may slow the progression of HIV infection. DTH responses to HIV-derived recombinant envelope glycoprotein could provide a means of measuring an important immune function in infected patients, and serve as an easily measured surrogate marker of cellular immunity. In addition to eliciting local, cutaneous DTH responses, intradermal inoculation of skin test antigens may be immunogenic, resulting in new antibody production and cellular immune responses. This study allows direct comparison of gp160 administered intradermally with alum-adjuvanted intramuscular preparation with respect to immunogenicity in HIV seropositive patients.","Early immunity to HIV may play an important role in the long interval between virus infection and the onset of clinical disease.

Each of 10 volunteers is initially injected with the lowest dose of intradermal antigen and the injection site observed at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Clinical and laboratory evaluations are performed 4 and 8 weeks after inoculation. If there is not delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to the lowest dose, patients are retested at the next dose 8 weeks later and dose escalation is continued at 8-week intervals until (1) there is a DTH response to gp160; or (2) the maximum anticipated dose is reached. In any individual, a higher dosage is administered only if there is no evidence of DTH response. Patients with a DTH may continue to receive booster injections of gp160 at 3 month intervals up to week 70. Patients with an immune response but no DTH may continue to receive injections for an additional year. A second group of 10 asymptomatic individuals are recruited and inoculated with the dose found to bring about either a DTH or lymphocyte proliferative response in 7 of the 10 patients in the first group. If the second group confirms the results of the initial group, the study is amended to include patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC) and AIDS.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria

ORIGINAL DESIGN: To determine the effectiveness and safety of ganciclovir (DHPG) therapy in AIDS patients suffering from active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of the retina of the eye (retinitis) when the drug is administered directly into the fluid-filled vitreous cavity of the eye by injection.

CMV retinitis is the most frequently seen opportunistic infection of the eye in AIDS patients, and left untreated can lead to severe visual loss and blindness. While systemic administration of DHPG has been shown to be an effective treatment for CMV retinitis, the chronic administration required may be complicated by decreased blood cell counts (granulocytopenia) which may require discontinuation of treatment. While withholding treatment may allow recovery from the granulocytopenia, interruption of therapy may result in reactivation of the retinitis. Injection of DHPG into the vitreous cavity of the eye may be of benefit to severely neutropenic patients with CMV retinitis.","CMV retinitis is the most frequently seen opportunistic infection of the eye in AIDS patients, and left untreated can lead to severe visual loss and blindness.

An additional goal of the study is to obtain a preliminary indication of the antiviral effects of Cd4-IgG in patients with AIDS or ARC.

Other approaches in addition to existing treatment of HIV infection need to be evaluated. One approach may be to block HIV infection by interrupting the assembly of the virus within the cell or the budding of virus from the membrane of the infected cell. In addition, blocking the attachment of HIV to its cellular receptor may offer another point of attack. HIV binds to the CD4 receptor on the target T4 lymphocyte and the envelope glycoprotein of the virus (gp120) is capable of high affinity binding to CD4. Any agent that prevents the attachment of gp120 to the CD4 receptor should be able to block virus transmission and spread. Recently, scientists have succeeded in producing highly purified recombinant soluble human CD4. Recombinant CD4 is capable of binding to HIV envelope protein (gp120) and inhibiting HIV infectivity in test tube studies. Potential therapeutic benefit in patients with HIV infection could be derived from either or both of these biologic effects. In order to extend the length of time that rCD4 stays in the body, the compound has been modified by combining it with a human immunoglobulin of the IgG1 class (IgG).","Other approaches in addition to existing treatment of HIV infection need to be evaluated.

Primarily, to compare the rates of invasive infections by C. neoformans, endemic mycoses, and Candida. To compare the mortality rates due to fungal infections between two antifungal prophylactic treatments. Secondarily, to assess the effect of prophylaxis on the incidence of severe fungal infections, defined as invasive infections and esophageal candidiasis and less severe mucocutaneous infection.

Serious fungal infections are significant complicating and life-threatening occurrences in patients with advanced HIV infection. Oropharyngeal candidiasis is found in almost all such patients, and causes pain, difficulty in swallowing, and loss of appetite. Similarly, esophageal candidiasis causes illness in the population. Cryptococcosis, endemic mycoses, and coccidioidomycosis also cause significant illness and death in AIDS patients. Once established, fungal infections in AIDS patients generally require continuous suppressive therapy because attempts at curing these infections are usually unsuccessful. Fluconazole has a number of characteristics that would make it a logical candidate to examine as a prophylactic agent in patients with advanced HIV infection. Animal studies have shown it to be prophylactic in models of candidiasis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis. Initial experience in patients with active cryptococcal meningitis appears favorable, and studies of oropharyngeal candidiasis show it to be effective.","Serious fungal infections are significant complicating and life-threatening occurrences in patients with advanced HIV infection.

Patients included in this study have KS, which is a type of cancer that occurs in nearly 20 percent of patients with AIDS. AIDS patients with extensive KS require treatment with effective cytotoxic (anti-cancer) agents to reduce the tumor size and with antiretroviral agents such as AZT to prevent or ameliorate the development of opportunistic infections. Due to the significant toxic effect of both cytotoxic and antiviral agents on the bone marrow where new blood cells are generated, the combination of these agents is expected to result in complications such as granulocytopenia (very low granulocyte counts). Hematopoietic growth factors such as GM-CSF may reduce the severity and duration of marrow suppression. This may improve survival. Clinical trials of GM-CSF in HIV infected individuals with or without granulocytopenia have shown that the progenitor cells (early blood cells) are responsive to GM-CSF.","Patients included in this study have KS, which is a type of cancer that occurs in nearly 20 percent of patients with AIDS.

An additional goal is to determine which dose level of vaccine might be most effective. Specific questions to be addressed in this part of the study include: Are there adverse reactions to gp160 vaccine when given to vaccinees previously immunized with a vaccinia-recombinant? Does gp160 vaccination of prior HIVAC-1e vaccine result in stimulation of neutralizing antibody and other humoral immune responses? Does vaccination with gp160 enhance the development of cell-mediated immune responses in HIVAC-1e vaccinees?

Since there is no known cure for AIDS, the control of this disease necessitates the development of effective prevention such as vaccines.

AMENDED: Participants in the amended study will be given one injection in the deltoid muscle of gp160 vaccine. The injection of gp160 will be given 2 months after the first take with the HIVAC-1e vaccine. After each inoculation, volunteers will be observed for one hour. For four days after each inoculation, each participant will be interviewed daily to monitor side effects and asked to record their temperature and symptoms twice daily. It is anticipated that a cohort of approximately 20 HIVAC-1e recipients from the participating AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Units will agree to receive the booster immunizations of gp160, and that this number of patients will be adequate to determine the booster effect of gp160. Original design: Study patients receive two immunizations, one at the beginning of the study and a second one eight weeks later. These immunizations are administered by scarification on the arm, the same way that smallpox vaccines were given for several years. The patients are divided into two groups. The control group receives a derivative of the smallpox vaccine that is used to produce HIVAC-1e vaccine. The treatment group actually receives HIVAC-1e. Whether a patient receives the parent virus or the vaccine is determined randomly by computer, and neither the patient nor the physician knows who actually receives the vaccine. The group receiving the parent virus and the group receiving HIVAC-1e are then divided into three subgroups receiving different doses of HIVAC-1e, in order to test the effectiveness of different doses of HIVAC-1e. Following the first inoculation and the booster inoculation eight weeks later, patients have the vaccination site covered with a special waterproof bandage until the vaccination site has healed. Participants are counseled on how to avoid contact spread of the vaccine virus including hand washing, management of the bandage, and separation from persons at high risk for the complications of the virus infection. Patients are closely followed for the first four weeks following immunization and then followed for a minimum of one year. Women are included only if willing to provide continuing information on sexual practices and menstrual patterns, and furnish urine samples, as appropriate, for pregnancy testing on the day of/before vaccination and every other week throughout the 56th day after receipt of vaccine. At the Johns Hopkins site, patients are compensated depending on how far they have to travel as long as they commit to every-other-day visits for the first 30 days. This is to change the bandage and check on healing. Interested patients should call collect for additional information about travel pay.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria

The study also begins an assessment of the effectiveness of d4T therapy on HIV replication, on plasma levels of p24 antigen, and clinical or immunologic parameters associated with AIDS.

Of the methods that are being evaluated to treat HIV-infected individuals, AZT has produced the best results to date. Toxic effects in approximately 50 percent of patients receiving AZT may limit its usefulness for prolonged treatment. Long-term treatment may be necessary to prevent progression of early stage HIV infection to AIDS and to prevent secondary transmission. Other drugs that may be equally or more effective than AZT and useful in the long- term treatment of HIV infection must be developed and evaluated. Test-tube and animal studies of d4T show that the drug can inhibit replication (reproduction) of HIV at concentrations similar to concentrations of AZT that have anti-HIV activity. These studies also indicate that the drug may stay in the bloodstream longer than AZT. Thus, it may be possible for the drug to be as effective as AZT when taken less frequently than AZT. It also may have a less disturbing effect on other body functions (such as thymidine metabolism).","Of the methods that are being evaluated to treat HIV-infected individuals, AZT has produced the best results to date.

All patients entering the study beginning January 2, 1990 will receive foscarnet maintenance therapy on a 120/mg/kg/day algorithm following induction.

AMENDED: The ACTG 093 optional extended maintenance therapy period will conclude on January 2, 1991 in order to facilitate timely analysis of this study. All patients who wish to continue foscarnet therapy should be referred to Astra Protocol 90-FOS-14 at telephone number 800-292-5775. Original design: Patients are placed into two groups: (1) patients who have a sight-threatening lesion in the retina of an eye with vision that can be saved (corrected vision of 20/100 or better) and who cannot be treated with DHPG, and (2) patients whose retinitis has quickly gotten worse and/or has shown resistance to DHPG treatment. Both groups will receive a beginning (induction) dose of foscarnet by vein (IV) for 2 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose for 8 weeks with an option to continue up to 24 weeks. AMENDED: Patients entering the study on or after 01/02/90 receive the standard two week course of foscarnet induction therapy and receive maintenance therapy. Treatment is given for a ten week study period or until progression occurs or toxicity endpoints are reached. If retinitis is stable and foscarnet well-tolerated, maintenance therapy may be extended for a period not to exceed 1 year.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria

CMV retinitis is one of the most common opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS. DHPG is at present the only drug available for widespread compassionate use in the United States. Although most patients respond to treatment with DHPG, the medication does not cure the infection. Most patients will have a relapse and will require retreatment with DHPG. Because of the large relapse rate, most people treated for CMV retinitis are placed on continuous treatment with DHPG. There are two major problems associated with ongoing use of DHPG: 1) The development of a low white blood cell (WBC) count (leukopenia) which is a known side effect of the drug; and 2) the increased risk for leukopenia when DHPG is given together with AZT, the only antiviral drug currently available for the treatment of HIV infection. Therefore, patients cannot take both AZT and DHPG at the same time because the bone marrow toxicity is made much more severe when the drugs are given together. This has resulted in the difficult decision as to whether to forgo potential life-extending therapy with AZT in order to preserve sight. An effective treatment for CMV retinitis is needed that will allow the patient to also take AZT. ACV is presently the drug of choice for severe herpes virus infections. It has been shown to be effective in suppressing severe CMV disease in patients who have received bone marrow transplants.","CMV retinitis is one of the most common opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS.

In addition, the studies will determine preliminary data on response, immune function, and subcutaneous absorption.

IFN-B has demonstrated a dose-dependent ability to suppress the replication of HIV in the test tube. In addition, previous studies have shown AZT to be an effective inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase; Phase I and II study benefits of AZT treatment include increased objective clinical improvement, decreased mortality rate, and decreased incidence of opportunistic infections. Long-term AZT use, however, presents possible limitations secondary to intolerance. This study, therefore, will investigate the potential antiviral activities of a combination of IFN-B and AZT to determine the safety and efficacy of such treatment in patients with AIDS related Kaposi's sarcoma.

In addition, these patients cannot be treated with ganciclovir (DHPG) because of its toxic effect on the body's blood-forming cells or because white blood cell or platelet counts were too low.

CMV is a common virus, which can cause blindness and death in AIDS patients. Previous studies demonstrate that foscarnet has been effective in both AIDS and non-AIDS patients with CMV infection. Although treatment with ganciclovir (DHPG) is also effective, a significant toxicity leading to dose-limiting neutropenia (low white blood cell count) in one third of treated patients has been associated with the drug. Based on the serious nature of CMV retinitis and the lack of alternative drug therapies for DHPG-sensitive patients, the present study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) foscarnet in AIDS patients with CMV retinitis.","CMV is a common virus, which can cause blindness and death in AIDS patients.

Based on the serious nature of CMV retinitis and the lack of alternative drug therapies for DHPG-sensitive patients, the present study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) foscarnet in AIDS patients with CMV retinitis.

Following routine evaluation studies, patients are randomized to receive foscarnet right away or to delay treatment, as their retinitis has been determined not to be immediately sight-threatening. Patients are hospitalized for the first 3 days and may remain hospitalized for as many as 14 days. Foscarnet is given by vein (IV) in what is called induction therapy, and if the patient's retinitis stabilizes after 2 weeks of treatment, treatment with foscarnet is continued in maintenance therapy for another 8 weeks. During maintenance therapy, patients receive salt solution IV to help prevent any toxic side effect of foscarnet on the kidneys. Patients have regular checkups to monitor their retinitis as well as their general health. Patients taking zidovudine (AZT) prior to entering the study may continue their treatment if they are selected for the delayed treatment group; if they are selected for the immediate treatment group, they begin or resume AZT therapy when they enter the 2nd week of maintenance therapy. Patients are followed as outpatients for at least 10 weeks, with clinic check-ups and lab tests once every week; eye exams are done once a week for the first 2 weeks and then every other week. If clinically indicated, a continued maintenance regimen may be administered after the 10th week; the total duration of therapy plus maintenance is not to exceed 24 weeks. Note: Patients scheduled for the delayed foscarnet treatment are immediately given foscarnet at the first sign that their retinitis is getting worse.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria

HIV infects and inactivates certain blood cells that are part of the body's immune system. The damage to the body's immune system can result in unusual infections and/or unusual forms of cancer. A large percentage of hemophiliacs are HIV-positive and there is a clear risk for the development of AIDS in these patients. AZT may be effective in lowering HIV levels and boosting the immune system but its side effects are not understood in these patients.","There is a clear risk for development of AIDS in hemophilic patients. AZT administration has been shown to inhibit HIV replication in vitro. Patients taking AZT have experienced fewer opportunistic infections and improvements in measures of immunity. The most common laboratory abnormalities observed with AZT are hematologic. However, the clinical and laboratory toxicity of AZT remains poorly understood in hemophiliacs. Hepatitis and liver dysfunction are more common in this population compared to other groups at risk for HIV infection. Because AZT is largely metabolized in the liver, drug pharmacokinetics needs to be evaluated in this patient population.

Both hemophiliacs and non-hemophiliacs take AZT for a period of 12 weeks. The first dose is administered intravenously. AZT is then given orally every 4 hours while awake (5 doses per day). Patients are evaluated by physical examinations and laboratory assessments. These include HIV culture of blood and leukocyte counts, lymphocyte counts, and lymphocyte subsets measured at study entry and every 4 weeks thereafter. Patients are hospitalized for pharmacokinetic studies at study entry and at Weeks 6 and 12. Each of these studies involves both intravenous and oral administration within 48 hours of one another.

Other goals include the measurement of the actual amount of PEN that reaches the lung, and to determine if close clinical observation is safer and as effective as drug therapy for the prevention of subsequent episodes of PCP.

Many AIDS patients develop PCP, but the effectiveness of early diagnosis and treatment of PCP is not known. The effectiveness of PEN may be improved if treatment is begun when the parasite burden (the number of organisms in the lung) is still small, and before respiratory symptoms appear. If PFT of HIV-infected patients is able to identify patients in the early stages of infection, outpatient treatment of these patients offers a possible alternative to the expense and toxicity of continuous preventive therapy of all high-risk patients.","Many AIDS patients develop PCP, but the effectiveness of early diagnosis and treatment of PCP is not known.

Patients are treated with aerosolized PEN on an outpatient basis. The aerosol therapy is given by a respiratory therapist 5 times a week, for a total of 21 days of treatment. In addition, patients participate in two radioactive aerosol studies in which the patient inhales a radioactive gas while sitting with his/her back against a gamma camera. The resulting picture outlines the lungs. Then the gas is exhaled and the patient breathes an aerosol of PEN. This mist contains a single dose of PEN mixed with a small amount of radioactivity (99mTc-pertechnetate). The gamma camera determines where the particles deposit in the lungs. The radioactive exposure is equivalent to a typical x-ray of the ribs. Patients also undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy with lavage, and PFT. Blood is drawn to measure the blood level of PEN. Patients are followed (clinical exams and PFT's) for 6 months after the end of therapy. Prophylaxis for PCP is allowed during the 6-month follow-up.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria

The study evaluates two doses of AZT used alone versus two doses of AZT combined with ACV. Per 12/11/92 amendment: Another antiretroviral agent may be substituted for AZT.

AZT has been shown to increase the life span of patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex and patients being treated for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Drugs that increase the effectiveness of AZT against HIV may also decrease the need for high doses of AZT. This might reduce some of the negative effects of AZT while not reducing the positive effects.","AZT has been shown to increase the life span of patients with AIDS or advanced AIDS related complex and patients being treated for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

AMENDED: 08/01/90 As of August 31, 1989, 437 patients were enrolled into uncontrolled studies of trimetrexate for PCP:214 in TX 301/ACTG 0=039 (trimetrexate for patients intolerant of approved therapies) and 223 in NS 401 (trimetrexate for patients refractory to approved therapies). The analysis of overall response rate, stringently defined as having received at least 14 days of trimetrexate and being alive at follow-up 1 month after the completion of therapy, reveals 84/159 intolerant patients and 48/160 refractory patients had responded, for rates of 53 percent and 30 percent, respectively. These response rates include all individuals who received at least one dose of trimetrexate. Of the 111 patients who were ventilator-dependent at study entry, 18 completed a course of therapy and were alive a month later, for a response rate of 16 percent. All other ventilated patients died.

Toxicity required discontinuation of therapy in approximately 5 percent of all patients.

Original design: The drugs usually used to treat PCP in AIDS patients, trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole and pentamidine, have had to be discontinued in many patients because of severe side effects. Currently there are no proven alternatives to these drugs. TMTX was chosen for this trial because it was found to be very active against the PCP organism in laboratory tests.

As many as 80 percent of AIDS patients experience at least one episode of PCP and about one-third of these patients have a recurrence of the disease. Drugs currently used for treatment of acute PCP are toxic to the majority of AIDS patients. The combination of clindamycin and primaquine reduces the numbers of PCP organisms in laboratory tests and in animal studies. Both drugs can be given orally, concentrate in lung tissue, and have been used safely in humans for treatment of other diseases. It is possible that the combination may prove to be as good or better than standard therapy for PCP and side effects may be less.","As many as 80 percent of AIDS patients experience at least one episode of PCP and about one-third of these patients have a recurrence of the disease.

It is possible that the combination may prove to be as good or better than standard therapy for PCP and side effects may be less.

The proposal for the first 20 patients enrolled in ACTG 044 initially called for an open-labelled, pilot study of intravenous (IV) clindamycin and primaquine therapy in patients with mild to moderate PCP. Preliminary results of the first 22 patients entered into ACTG 044 indicate that the response rate to therapy was over 90 percent. The rate of discontinuation secondary to toxic side effects was only 20 percent. Additional uncontrolled studies have shown an excellent clinical response and safety profile in another 60 patients. The protocol has been amended to provide an all oral dosing regimen. An additional 20 patients with mild PCP will be enrolled and tested with oral clindamycin and primaquine on an outpatient basis. All patients will receive clindamycin and primaquine. Total duration of therapy will be 21 days. Patients may be hospitalized at any time during the study as clinically indicated. Treatment with zidovudine may be started or resumed after completion of clindamycin / primaquine therapy.

AIDS is a serious infectious disease caused by a new family of retrovirus which is spread primarily through sexual contact and administration of blood or blood products. Individuals who are infected with HIV could therefore benefit from therapy with an effective anti-AIDS virus agent. AZT and ddC have both been tested as antiviral agents and their potentially beneficial effects may be limited by time- and dose-dependent toxicity. A combination regimen using shorter courses of AZT and ddC might therefore be able to sustain treatment without producing toxicity. In addition, since the two drugs exhibit their major toxicity on different organ systems, cumulative or additive toxicity would not be expected.","AIDS is a serious infectious disease caused by a new family of retrovirus which is spread primarily through sexual contact and administration of blood or blood products.

In addition, since the two drugs exhibit their major toxicity on different organ systems, cumulative or additive toxicity would not be expected.

There are six study regimens. Four of these are alternating regimens: A 2-week cycle consisting of 1 week of AZT followed by 1 week of ddC and an 8-week cycle consisting of 4 weeks of AZT followed by 4 weeks of ddC. All patients on alternating regimens will receive AZT alone at the standard dose orally every 4 hours for either 1 or 4 weeks. After the AZT is stopped, patients receive ddC orally every 4 hours for either 1 or 4 weeks, which completes a treatment cycle. One of two doses of ddC is studied in each alternating regimen. Both doses must be tested because the optimal dose cannot be inferred from tests that have already been done. AZT is administered first in the hope that AZT-mediated reduction of p24 antigen load may reduce the occurrence of acute ddC toxicity. Two intermittent regimens are also studied and are included to assess the contribution of each drug in the alternating regimens. One program consists of 1 week of AZT followed by 1 week of no drug. The other consists of 1 week of ddC followed by 1 week of no drug. Drug dosing continues for a total of 48 weeks unless toxicity develops. Patients who complete 48 weeks of therapy are followed for 4 additional weeks off therapy. Patients removed from study because of toxicity are followed for 4 weeks or until toxicity resolves.

The drugs trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole (TMP / SMX) and pentamidine, usually used to treat PCP in AIDS patients, have proven ineffective in many patients and have had to be discontinued in many other patients because of severe side effects. TMTX was chosen for this trial because it was found to be very active against the PCP organism in laboratory tests and, in a preliminary trial in combination with LCV, there was a high response rate without severe toxicity.","The drugs trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole (TMP / SMX) and pentamidine, usually used to treat PCP in AIDS patients, have proven ineffective in many patients and have had to be discontinued in many other patients because of severe side effects.

AMENDED: 08/01/90. As of August 31, 1989, 437 patients were enrolled into uncontrolled studies of trimetrexate for PCP: 214 in TX 301/ACTG 039 (trimetrexate for patients intolerant of approved therapies) and 223 in NS 401 (trimetrexate for patients refractory to approved therapies). The analysis of overall response rate, stringently defined as having received at least 14 days of trimetrexate and being alive at follow-up 1 month after the completion of therapy, reveals 84/159 intolerant patients and 48/160 refractory patients had responded, for rates of 53 percent and 30 percent, respectively. These response rates include all individuals who received at least one dose of trimetrexate. Of the 111 patients who were ventilator-dependent at study entry, 18 completed a course of therapy and were alive a month later, for a response rate of 16 percent. All other ventilated patients died. The most common severe (grades 3 and 4) toxicities were: transaminase elevation (> 5 x normal) in 94 patients, anemia (< 7.9 g/dl) in 109, neutropenia (< 750 cells/mm3) in 58, fever (> 40 C) in 37, and thrombocytopenia (< 50000 platelets/mm3) in 27.

Toxicity required discontinuation of therapy in approximately 5 percent of all patients. Original design: Patients entered in the study are given TMTX once a day for 21 days and LCV 4 times a day (every 6 hours) for 24 days. Doses are determined by body size. Both drugs are given by intravenous infusion, but LCV may be given orally after the first 10 days. Doses are adjusted if side effects, such as low white blood cell count, are too severe. During the 21-day trial, zidovudine (AZT) may not be used, because of possible increased bone marrow toxicity. AZT may be resumed as soon as the administration of TMTX and LCV has been completed. After treatment with TMTX, the patient may be treated with other drugs to prevent the recurrence of PCP at the discretion of his/her physician.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria

The purpose of this study is to collect and evaluate these data from HIV infected and at-risk women to better understand and provide support for women whom are currently HIV infected or who are at risk for HIV infection.","HIV in women is increasing worldwide, with women comprising approximately 14% of the total adult and adolescent AIDS cases, the highest proportion yet reported. The impact of AIDS is particularly severe in minority populations; among women, African Americans, and Hispanics combined now represent the majority of AIDS cases (76%) in the United States. AIDS is now the third leading cause of death for women aged 25 to 44 (after cancer and cardiovascular disease) and is the leading cause of death of African American women in this age group.

Studies of HIV and AIDS in women can play a unique role in testing new biological or socio-behavioral hypotheses at the population level and in linking basic science findings and laboratory methods to well-defined populations and communities. Research areas that are likely to draw more attention in the near future will include the study of pathogenicity and transmissibility of different HIV subtypes or recombinant forms and their interaction with variably susceptible individuals; the change in the scope of HIV natural history studies in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy; and the contribution of such studies to the design of a wide spectrum of prevention modalities (e.g., prevention of HIV and prevention of opportunistic infections). In addition, studies of natural history of HIV-related malignancies and active surveillance of malignancies in HIV infected and high-risk uninfected women may lead to new screening and prevention modalities in high-risk populations of women.

A combination of drugs (azithromycin plus atovaquone) will be compared to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) alone. This study also evaluates the long-term safety and tolerance of these different drugs.

SMX/TMP is a commonly prescribed drug for the prevention of bacterial infections. However, the combination of azithromycin and atovaquone may be safer and more effective than SMX/TMP. This study compares the 2 treatments.","Although SMX/TMP remains the drug of choice for PCP prophylaxis, drug sensitivity may limit its use. Atovaquone has demonstrated greater safety than SMX/TMP and thus is suitable as a candidate drug for treatment and prophylaxis of PCP. Azithromycin, with a broad anti-microbial spectrum (including mycoplasma and atypical mycoplasma), is an attractive prophylactic agent for use in children with HIV infection, due to its relative safety and once-daily dosing regimen. Therefore, the combination of atovaquone and azithromycin may offer broader antimicrobial coverage and greater safety than SMX/TMP.

Patients are randomized to receive either SMX/TMP or combination micronized atovaquone/azithromycin. Crossover to the alternative regimen may occur if serious toxicity is observed. Patients are monitored for occurrence of serious bacterial infections or PCP breakthrough, and when a serious bacterial infection occurs, patients are crossed over to the alternative regimen.

This study also evaluates the effect of rIL-2 on the immune system of these patients.

IL-2 is a substance naturally produced by the body's white blood cells that plays an important role in helping the body fight infection. HIV-infected patients do not produce enough IL-2, and it is hoped that the use of rIL-2 may improve immune system function in these patients. First, it is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of this drug in HIV-infected children.","According to study records, IL-2 has not been tested in HIV-infected children. Experience with IL-2 in pediatric populations is extremely limited. Pahwa et al. gave 30,000 units/kg daily IV to a child with severe combined immunodeficiency. This dose was well tolerated and the patient improved clinically as well as immunologically. Part A is necessary to determine the maximum tolerated dose of IL-2 in infected children. Part B will determine the efficacy of the maximum tolerated dose in infected children.

Part A: Children will receive rIL-2 intravenously for 5 days every 8 weeks for 3 cycles. The study will enroll 4 patients in each of 3 dose levels. Dose escalation may occur if all 4 patients in a dose level tolerate therapy without evidence of Grade 3 (or higher) toxicity. If 1 of 4 subjects in any dose level experiences at least Grade 3 toxicity, 2 additional patients will be enrolled in that dose level. If 1 of these 2 additional patients experiences at least Grade 3 toxicity, dose escalation will not proceed. NOTE: Once Part A is completed and the maximum tolerated dose is established, children who participated in Part A and received less than the maximum tolerated dose will be offered additional therapy consisting of 3 cycles of rIL-2 at the maximum tolerated dose.

Part B: Children will receive rIL-2 intravenously at the maximum tolerated dose established in part A. Treatment will be given for 5 days every 8 weeks for 3 cycles.

GM-CSF is a medication that is being tested in HIV-positive patients to see if it can improve their immune systems or if it can lower the level of HIV in their blood. GM-CSF is often given to patients with leukemia or patients who have received bone marrow transplants to increase their white blood cells and to improve their immune systems. Doctors believe that GM-CSF can increase CD4 counts in HIV-positive patients, but this study will also look at how GM-CSF affects viral load.","GM-CSF promotes the differentiation and activation of granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells and enhances the function of these cells. The various cellular responses (i.e., division, maturation, activation) are induced when GM-CSF binds to specific receptors expressed on the surface of target cells. At higher doses, such as the dose used in this protocol, GM-CSF may result in a rapid rise in white blood cell count. However, further research is necessary to determine the potential antiviral effect of GM-CSF in a potent ART-treated population. It is hoped that GM-CSF can decrease the extent of ongoing HIV replication via alteration of macrophage activation and chemokine receptor expression and that this effect can result in reduction of the pool of latently infected T cells.

Patients are stratified at study entry according to screening CD4 count (below 200 cells/mm3 versus 200 cells/mm3 or higher) and screening HIV-1 RNA copy number (between 1,500 and 10,000 versus 10,000 copies/ml or higher). Then, patients are randomized to receive GM-CSF or GM-CSF placebo subcutaneously 3 times per week for 16 weeks. All patients remain on their current stable potent ART (not provided by this study). During Step 2, all patients receive open-label study treatment, consisting of current potent ART plus GM-CSF subcutaneously 3 times per week for 32 additional weeks. HIV-1 RNA, CD4 counts, and clinical and safety parameters are monitored for all patients periodically until Week 52. Patients who experience an increase in HIV-1 RNA of greater than 1 log 10 from baseline on 2 consecutive determinations or a greater than 50% decrease in CD4 count from baseline (a drop of at least 50 cells) on 2 consecutive determinations at any time during Step 1 or 2 must discontinue all study treatment. Patients who discontinue study treatment for any reason prior to Week 16 continue following the study visit schedule through Week 16.

Background AR therapy may also be no background therapy, although use of protease inhibitors as monotherapy is not recommended unless there is no alternative. Patients will be allowed to cross over to the alternate protease inhibitor if they reach a primary study endpoint. Data will be collected every 4 months.

[AS PER AMENDMENT 10/2/97: Patients assigned to the NFV arm who develop a significant intolerance may switch to RTV or IDV; those assigned to the RTV arm who develop a significant intolerance are encouraged to switch to IDV (NFV allowed if IDV contraindicated). Switchover for intolerance is strongly discouraged during the first 4 weeks of follow-up. Patients initially assigned to NFV therapy who experience disease progression may switch to RTV; if RTV is not tolerated, patients may switch to IDV. Because of the cross-resistance between RTV and IDV, patients who progress on RTV should switch to NFV.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/15/98: Patients originally assigned to NFV who experience poor virologic control or disease progression should change to RTV or IDV or enroll in the PIP protocol (CPCRA 057). Conversely, patients originally assigned to RTV should change to NFV or enroll in the PIP protocol (such patients continue to be followed on this study). Because of cross-resistance between RTV and IDV, change from RTV to IDV is discouraged. Determination of poor virologic control or disease progression is at the discretion of the patient's clinician. Change in background antiretroviral therapy should occur at the same time that the protease inhibitor is changed for poor virologic control or progression; the choice of new background antiretroviral agents is at the discretion of the clinician.] Randomization is stratified by clinical site.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 3/11/98: SUBSTUDY CPCRA 045: At least 600 patients (>= 400 from CPCRA sites and >= 200 from CTN sites) will be enrolled in the substudy. These patients will have a plasma sample collected for HIV RNA and genotypic resistance within 30 days prior to randomization, at the 1-month visit, and at the q-4-month study visits thereafter until the end of the study. CD4+ cell counts will be done at the 1-month visit and at the q-4-month study visits until the end of the study. A subset of patients will also have immunophenotyping of CD4+ and CD8+ cell TCR V-beta clones carried out before and during treatment. Another subset of patients at selected sites will have viral cultures performed for phenotypic drug sensitivity testing.

Initially, specimens for 50 randomly chosen patients in the group originally assigned RTV will be identified for resistance testing. Of this group, specimens for those who have received RTV/IDV for more than 1 month will be analyzed for genotypic resistance to obtain an estimate of the rate of resistance development and to estimate the risk of disease progression associated with resistance to RTV/ZDV. Based on these estimates, determination will be made of the total number of patients and specimens in both treatment groups in order to address the primary objective of comparing genotypic resistance in the two groups.]",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria

Infection with MAC is a poor prognostic indicator in persons with AIDS.

Survival of AIDS patients with MAC is shorter than those without MAC. Studies show that treatment for MAC improves the survival of MAC infected patients to nearly the survival of AIDS patients without MAC.

This study also evaluates the correct dosages of ABC to be used in future studies.

Early aggressive therapy may be the best chance to slow disease progression in infants who may have been infected with HIV by their mothers. Early HIV suppression may significantly reduce viral levels and allow for restoration of the immune system, providing improved control over HIV infection. Therefore, it is important that the safety and tolerance of ABC in combination with ZDV be examined as potential early therapy in newborn and young infants.","The rationale for investigation of this agent is to define the safety and pharmacokinetics in young infants to allow for investigation of the efficacy of this agent in combination with ZDV as potential early therapy in newborn and young infants. The rationale for early aggressive therapy is that this may be the best chance to significantly reduce the long-term progression and subsequent impact of HIV-1 infection in vertically infected infants. Early ablation or enhanced suppression of HIV-1 replication may significantly reduce total viral load and may allow maturation, preservation, or reconstruction of immune function at a stage early in infection providing improved control of HIV-1 infection and reduced disease progression.

This oral vaccine (HIV-1 LAI gp120) will be given with or without a different injected HIV vaccine (HIV-1 MN rgp120).

Vaccines are preparations that are introduced into the body to try to prevent infection or create resistance to infection. This study examines a new oral vaccine to see if it can improve the immune system's ability to fight the HIV virus when given alone or with another injected vaccine.","Although recent advances have been made in antiviral therapy for AIDS, there is no cure for HIV-1 infection or AIDS, and drug therapy is too expensive for most affected populations. The development of safe, effective vaccines to prevent HIV-1 infection and AIDS worldwide is a global priority. One promising approach in the development of HIV-1 vaccines utilizes live vaccines as vectors to express HIV-1 antigens. The potential advantages of the live vector approach include the ability of live vector recombinants to induce long-lasting humoral and cell-mediated immunity (particularly neutralizing antibody and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell activity) and the relatively low cost of production. Moreover, live vector recombinant vaccines administered orally might be able to stimulate the production of secretory IgA vaccine-specific antibodies locally at relevant mucosal sites.

Part I of this study is conducted as an open-label, dose-escalation trial. The first 5 volunteers (Group A) receive a single oral dose of Salmonella typhi CVD 908-HIV-1 LAI gp 120 (VVG203). If no typhoid fever-like illness is seen in these volunteers during at least 14 days of follow-up, the next 5 patients (Group B) receive a single dose of VVG203.

This study will also test the safety of the drug and see how well it is tolerated by the mother and her baby.

Previous studies suggest that NVP is a promising medication for blocking HIV transmission from HIV-positive mothers to their babies.","Nevirapine has several properties that make it an attractive candidate for antiretroviral therapy to interrupt HIV-1 transmission in the intrapartum and early postpartum period. The pharmacokinetic profile suggested that nevirapine would be rapidly absorbed and transferred to the infant in utero when given during labor and delivery. In addition, nevirapine has been shown to penetrate cell-free virions and inactivate virion-associated reverse transcriptase (RT) in situ. This property would be potentially useful in inactivating cell-free virions in the genital tract as well as in breast milk. These characteristics of nevirapine suggest that treatment of an HIV-infected pregnant woman in labor with an oral dose of nevirapine may provide a prophylactic level of nevirapine in the infant during the time of exposure to virus in the birth canal and/or maternal blood. In addition, nevirapine may inactivate the virion-associated RT present in cell-free virions in the genital tract or breast milk.

Women are randomized to receive either NVP or the corresponding placebo in active labor.

Mothers are followed on study for 4 to 6 weeks postpartum. Mothers are also encouraged to follow the regimen of zidovudine (ZDV) outlined in the Office of Public Health and Science (PHS) treatment guidelines for both themselves and their infants. Infants are administered either NVP or placebo between 48 and 72 hours of life. The infant's study drug is the same as the mother's randomized treatment assignment.

To compare the safety and tolerance of these regimens and their effect on quality of life. To assess the effects of rhIL-2 when combined with HAART on changes in immune cell phenotypes and function and on HIV viral load and the rate of antiviral drug resistance development.

The poor responsiveness of late stage HIV-infected patients to rhIL-2 is thought to occur because of low T cell regenerative capacity and high viral burden. If means were available to effectively suppress virus replication, the indigenous immune restorative responses of the host may be further stimulated and enhanced by rhIL-2. The use of protease inhibitors with nucleoside-analogue combination regimens appears to be most effective in controlling virus replication. High-dose intermittent rhIL-2 administered either intravenously or subcutaneously has been shown to be effective in inducing CD4 responses in a number of studies.","The poor responsiveness of late stage HIV-infected patients to rhIL-2 is thought to occur because of low T cell regenerative capacity and high viral burden.

The purpose of this study is to see if giving CD4-IgG2 to HIV-infected children is safe and effective.

HIV attaches to CD4 cells and enters them. Inside, HIV makes copies of itself that will help the virus invade the body. CD4 cells are killed or disabled during this process of HIV replication. Decreases in CD4 cells lead to a weakened immune system. When CD4 cell counts become very low, the body is unable to defend itself, and HIV infection develops into AIDS. The protein used in this study, CD4-IgG2, may be able to attach to HIV and inactivate it so that it cannot enter CD4 cells. This is an early study to examine CD4-IgG2 as a possible treatment for HIV in children.","Since CD4 is the high-affinity receptor for HIV-1, molecules such as CD4-IgG2, which incorporate the gp120 binding region of CD4, have the potential to bind and neutralize all strains of the virus.

If none of these 3 patients experience Grade 3 or 4 toxicity, patients are escalated to the next dose level. If any of these 3 patients have life-threatening toxicities or if more than 1 of these 3 patients experience non-life-threatening Grade 3 or 4 toxicities, escalation stops and the prior dose (if any) is considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). If 1 of these 3 patients experiences non-life-threatening Grade 3 or 4 toxicities, 3 additional patients are treated at this dose level. If 1 or more of these 3 additional patients has Grade 3 or 4 toxicity, escalation stops. If none of these 3 additional patients has Grade 3 or 4 toxicity, patients are escalated to the next dose level.

It is important to determine which medications for HIV-associated diseases, such as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease, can be given safely and effectively with anti-HIV drugs. Indinavir and rifabutin have been given simultaneously in the past with good results. This study seeks to examine if staggering the doses will make the 2 drugs more effective. HIV-negative volunteers are used in this study to examine the effect of rifabutin on indinavir and the effect of staggered rifabutin doses. The effect of rifabutin on the drug activity of indinavir is evaluated in HIV-positive patients.","Currently, rifabutin is the only rifamycin that can be administered with indinavir. ACTG 365 is the first formal study of the pharmacokinetics of this dosing combination regimen in HIV seropositive patients. It is hypothesized that staggered administration of rifabutin and indinavir might minimize their pharmacokinetic interaction. If the intestinal tract plays a significant role in the presystemic clearance of rifabutin, the inhibitory activity of indinavir on rifabutin could depend on either luminal concentrations of indinavir, systematic concentrations of indinavir, or both. If luminal concentrations are important, then the interaction between these 2 drugs will be maximal when administered simultaneously, and minimal when their oral administration is staggered. Finally, since indinavir has a half-life of 1.8 hours, its effects on rifabutin's systematic clearance may be much less when administration of these drugs is staggered by 4 hours as compared with simultaneous administration with rifabutin. If the interaction on rifabutin is minimized, then the rifabutin levels may be suboptimal for treatment of tuberculosis in patients who are not administered the 2 drugs simultaneously. It is, therefore, important to define the magnitude of the effect of staggered vs simultaneous drug administration in order to clarify dose and regimen recommendations in HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis who also require protease inhibitor therapy.

Most HIV-positive pregnant women usually take the anti-HIV drug zidovudine (ZDV) to treat HIV and reduce the chances of giving HIV to their babies. It recently has been shown that a combination of drugs may be more effective than ZDV alone. This study tests the effectiveness of combinations of ZDV, d4T, and 3TC.","New antiretroviral agents or combinations are sought that are as efficacious as ZDV and that would be effective in reducing the rate of vertical transmission of HIV in women who have been long-term recipients of ZDV. d4T is a good candidate drug. It is a thymidine nucleoside analogue that inhibits replication of HIV at concentrations similar to those of ZDV which have anti-HIV activity. The demonstrated safety profile of d4T, the ease of administration, and, most importantly, preliminary efficacy data, especially in combination with 3TC, make this an excellent candidate combination for a Phase I perinatal trial.

Two cohorts of women and infants are enrolled in this study. The first five mother/infant pairs enrolled comprise Group I. Mothers enrolled in this group must allow their infants to receive ZDV.

The study will also look at how these vaccines affect a baby's immune system. Most HIV-positive children get HIV from their mothers during pregnancy or birth. Treatment with anti-HIV drugs can reduce the baby's risk of getting HIV. Vaccines also may help prevent HIV infection. This study will look at whether the ALVAC vCP1452 vaccine and the AIDSVAX B/B vaccine can help the body fight off HIV infection. There is no chance of getting HIV infection from the vaccines. (This study has been changed. In earlier versions, ALVAC vCP205 and AIDSVAX B/E were going to be used.)","Transmission of HIV from an untreated infected mother to her offspring is thought to occur to some infants perinatally and others at parturition. It is possible that administration of an immunogenic vaccine can reduce the vertical transmission of HIV-1 or moderate its course in infected infants. Successful early sensitization to HIV epitopes might succeed in preventing HIV infection. Alternately, the enhancement of HIV-specific immune function might also succeed in modifying HIV replication and affecting disease progression.

Sixty infants are treated in this randomized, double-blind study; 45 infants receive recombinant Canarypox virus, ALVAC-HIV vCP205, and 15 receive placebo. Mothers serve as proxy for their infants. All infants receive a minimum of four immunizations, at Weeks 0 (within 72 hours of birth), 4, 8, and 12. Initially, 24 patients are randomized to receive one of two doses of vCP205 or a saline placebo. When a suitable subunit vaccine is available, the protocol will be amended and 36 additional infants will be randomized to receive vCP205 alone or with a subunit vaccine at Weeks 4 and 8 (or vaccine placebo with or without subunit placebo).

Activation of T cells (cells of the immune system) leads to HIV replication. Inhibition of immune activation is therefore a potentially important area of therapy for patients with early HIV infection. CsA is capable of decreasing T cell activation, which in turn may decrease HIV replication.","There is increasing data on the potential for inhibition of immune activation as primary therapy for HIV infection. The rationale of CsA therapy is to decrease T cell activation in patients with early HIV infection. Activation of T cells leads to translation and transcription of provirus, release of viral progeny, and ultimately cell death. T cell activation also leads to increased cell death via apoptosis. CsA is capable of inhibiting both these events and thus may lead to decreased CD4 cell turnover.

Another goal is to test memory and mental concentrations to determine if anti-HIV drugs protect the brain from damage caused by HIV.

(The purpose of this study has been changed from the original version.) HIV-infected patients with low CD4 cell counts are at risk for getting opportunistic (AIDS-related) infections. CD4 cells are cells of the immune system that help fight infection. Anti-HIV therapy may increase CD4 counts, which may lead to a decrease in AIDS-related infections. Problems that anti-HIV therapy is associated with include metabolic problems, neurologic problems, abnormal opportunistic infections, and cancer. Patients in ACTG 362 have been exposed to anti-HIV therapy longer than any other large group in the ACTG. These patients appear to benefit from their therapy, but also suffer problems from it. Observation of these patients should provide more information about long-term anti-HIV treatment and may detect unexpected problems.

[AS PER AMENDMENT 11/16/99: The low rate of MAC in ACTG 362 patients after an average of 1 year of follow-up suggests that prophylaxis specifically for MAC disease with azithromycin is not necessary for patients who have experienced immune reconstitution. Prolonged follow-up will define durability of the antiretroviral response and the experience with opportunistic conditions, neurologic diseases, and survival, especially in those whose CD4 counts drop below 50 cells/mm3. It will also allow assessment of the levels of CD4 cell number at which vulnerability to opportunistic infection recur.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 03/18/03: During the extension of ACTG 362, serious complications of HAART have become better defined, including metabolic complications, neurologic problems, atypical opportunistic infections, and malignancies.

Many HIV-positive patients experience changes in body composition (muscle, fat, etc.) while on antiretroviral therapy. However, any weight gained while taking antiretrovirals is mostly fat. A patient's viral load may affect whether weight gained is a result of increased fat or increased muscle. A large-scale study is needed to closely evaluate the effects of antiretroviral therapy on body composition.","Effective antiretroviral therapy, as measured by a decrease in HIV-1 RNA levels, may sustain or improve important components of body composition, perhaps through a decrease in the underlying pro-inflammatory activity and resting energy expenditure. Moderate weight gain has been reported to be associated with HAART. Meaningful increase in total body weight, however, may need to be comprised of augmentation of lean body mass (primarily muscle), since mortality in HIV and cancer wasting is associated with sizable decreases in lean body mass (LBM) and there is no evidence that increases in fat cell mass are protective. To date, there has not been any large-scale prospective evaluation of the effects of HAART on body composition. Nor has it been determined whether increasing body weight or specific components of body composition (fat or lean body mass) in persons who have lost substantive amounts of weight protects against AIDS-defining complications or prolongs survival.

This is a 48-week, observational study of lean body mass, appetite, functional performance, and systemic markers of inflammation during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients co-enrolled in ACTG antiretroviral studies. Patients are stratified by body mass index (BMI) into 2 cohorts: less than 23 kg/m2 versus greater than or equal to 23 to 28 kg/m2. At selected study visits, times of antiretroviral medication change, and following the diagnosis of an AIDS-defining event, the following are assessed: height (screening visit only), weight, lean body mass, appetite (by questionnaire), functional performance (by questionnaire), and markers of systemic inflammation.",Observational,"Inclusion Criteria

However, the tolerability of DMP 266 in the pediatric population must be evaluated, and appropriate dosing instructions need to be developed. By following the patients over time, the antiviral activity of DMP 266-containing regimens will be documented. Dosage guidelines for children can then be developed following analysis of the results.

This is a 48-week [AS PER AMENDMENT (APA) 12/21/98:104-week] [APA 5/8/00: 208-week] study.

If at least 4 of the first 6 patients attain a tolerable dose (dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experience Grade 3 or worse toxicity) and target AUC, additional patients may continue to be accrued. However, if any of the initial 6 patients experience life-threatening toxicity, further accrual is suspended. [APA 5/26/98: An assessment of the tolerability and plasma concentrations of EFV is not required in an initial group of Cohort II patients. Individual dose is based on pharmacokinetic sampling.] Patients receive a given starting dose of DMP 266 and continue on that dose until individual dose adjustments are needed. If a patient's starting dose is tolerated but the target AUC is not achieved, the dose is increased. If the starting dose is well tolerated and target AUC achieved, no adjustment in starting dose is given to future patients. If no tolerated dose achieving at least an AUC of 150 micromoles/h is reached in 4 of 6 patients, the study is suspended and alternative dosing regimens, e.g., twice-daily dosing, are considered.

A patient's current dose of DMP 266 is adjusted based on how the dose is tolerated and whether the target AUC is achieved. If a patient does not achieve an AUC of greater than 110 micromoles/h and experiences Grade 3 or worse toxicity, the patient is discontinued from the study.

[APA 12/21/98: The dose of NFV is the same for patients in Cohort I and Stratum 2 of Cohort II; the dose for patients in Stratum 1 of Cohort II is higher.] The minimum target AUC for NFV is 10 mg x h/L.

After being stratified by the clinic and by stage of disease, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: intravenous (IV) cidofovir (Group I) or intraocular ganciclovir device plus oral ganciclovir (Group II). Group I: Cidofovir is administered IV once weekly for 2 consecutive weeks, then every 2 weeks thereafter. If progression occurs, oral ganciclovir is added to treatment or if this regimen is not tolerated, patients are treated according to the best medical judgment. Concurrent oral probenecid and intravenous hydration are administered with each cidofovir infusion. Group II: An intraocular ganciclovir device is surgically implanted at baseline and then every 6 to 8 months and ganciclovir is administered orally.

This study also evaluates the relationships between the amount of HIV in the blood, immune system functions, and the presence of MAC infection.

HIV-positive patients are at risk for MAC infection because their immune systems have been weakened by HIV. It is hoped that aggressive treatment with anti-HIV drugs may improve their immune systems enough to prevent against MAC.","The intent of this study is to define more precisely the natural history and immunopathogenesis of MAC disease in the HIV-infected population. It is suggested that MAC disease in AIDS patients results both from specific immunologic deficiencies caused by HIV infection of the host and as a result of specific mycobacterial virulence properties. Therefore, aggressive antiretroviral drug treatment of HIV-infected patients at risk for DMAC due to specific immune deficiencies will improve these immune functions in such a manner as to resist DMAC.

A total of 85 patients will be stratified at baseline into one of three groups:

Group I - 40 patients at high risk for MAC infection are neither followed beyond baseline nor receive study treatment.

Group II - 15 patients with DMAC, i.e., newly diagnosed MAC-bacteremic patients with no more than 72 hours prior treatment for MAC, receive individualized regimen of HAART for 48 weeks: nelfinavir (NEV), nevirapine (NVP), and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor(s) as per primary physician. Patients are evaluated through clinical, microbiologic, and virologic assessments, and intensive immunologic evaluations at Weeks 12, 24, and 48.

Group III - 30 asymptomatic HIV-infected patients are further stratified (15 patients/stratum) by CD4 count (less than or equal to 50 cells/mm3 or 100-250 cells/mm3). Patients in Group III follow the same HAART regimen and evaluations as Group II patients and continue evaluations for up to 48 weeks, if an acceptable response is found within 12 weeks of entry. Patients in Stratum 1 of Group III receive MAC prophylaxis with azithromycin once weekly with follow-up evaluations as in Group II. Patients in Group III that have a positive MAC blood or bone marrow culture at any time during the study will, from that point on, follow the same schedule of evaluations as patients in Group II.

[AS PER AMENDMENT 11/3/98: Up to 100 evaluable patients will now be studied. Group 2 is now modified to include up to an additional 15 evaluable patients with known MAC bacteremia and less than or equal to 7 days prior MAC treatment who are unable to commit to long-term follow-up (Group 2b); these patients will undergo only baseline evaluations.

This study will also evaluate whether adding GM-CSF or IL-12 to the anti-HIV drug regimen will increase the rate that HIV is reduced.

The anti-HIV drugs used in this study will include lamivudine (3TC), zidovudine (ZDV), indinavir (IDV), nevirapine (NVP), and stavudine (d4T). All have been used successfully to treat HIV. GM-CSF has been used to treat certain blood disorders; it will be used as an experimental drug in this study. IL-12 (interleukin-12) is a protein found naturally in the body that is thought to boost the immune system. Although GM-CSF and IL-12 have no direct effect against HIV, these drugs may improve the ability of the immune system to fight the virus.","Potent antiretroviral therapies that suppress HIV replication have permitted mathematical modeling of the dynamics of HIV infection and clearance by measurement of the decay of viral load in plasma. When de nova infection is blocked by antiretroviral therapy, the viral load decreases exponentially after a short initial lag time (""shoulder""). This rapid decline is followed by a slower second-phase decay. The intent of this study is to utilize four antiretroviral agents (zidovudine, lamivudine, nevirapine, indinavir) and very frequent measures of viral load to explore the drug-specific kinetics of the ""shoulder"". The decay of long-lived HIV-infected tissue macrophages is thought to be the major determinant of the slow second phase. Further, the study intends to use immune modulating agents with the potential to increase the turnover of infected macrophages, GM-CSF or IL-12, to accelerate the second phase of viral decay.

Patients are assigned to Group A (16 patients) or to Group B (8 patients). Patients in Group A are randomized to 1 of the following 4 initial treatment arms:

ARM A: Final dose combination (FDC) Zidovudine (ZDV)/Lamivudine (3TC). ARM B: Nevirapine (NVP). ARM C: Indinavir (IDV). ARM D: FDC ZDV/3TC plus NVP plus IDV. The initial regimen is maintained over the first 72 hours and blood for viral dynamic evaluations collected while patients are maintained as inpatients. Then, patients in Arms A, B, and C initiate FDC ZDV/3TC plus NVP plus IDV.

Patients assigned to Group B begin the following 4-drug regimen on Day 0:

ARM E: FDC ZDV/3TC plus NVP plus IDV.

On Day 7, patients in both Groups A and B are randomized to receive one of the following therapies in addition to their 4-drug regimen:

ARM F: GM-CSF daily for 2 weeks, then thrice weekly (MWF). ARM G: IL-12 twice weekly. ARM H: No immune modulation. Patients may be hospitalized to initiate immune modulation or may be treated as outpatients. Immune modulation is discontinued after Week 14. Patients maintain their 4-drug regimen through Week 48.

This study will also evaluate the differences in men and women in how the body absorbs, makes available, and removes ZDV.

Past research has shown that the effectiveness of ZDV as an anti-HIV drug might be decreased in individuals who use certain methods of birth control. ZDV may also have different effects in men compared to women.","Oral contraceptives have been shown to substantially enhance the glucuronidation of several compounds. One study reported enhanced glucuronidation of oxazepam, a compound that is conjugated via the same UDP-glucuronyl transferase isozyme responsible for ADV glucuronidation, suggesting that ZDV metabolism may be altered by concomitant oral contraceptive use. This potential enhancement of ZDV metabolism by oral contraceptives is expected to result in decreased plasma levels of the parent compound which may lead to diminished clinical efficacy in women using these drugs. It remains unclear whether the progesterone and/or estrogen component of oral contraceptives results in the observed glucuronidation changes.

This open-label, pharmacokinetic trial is conducted in 2 steps. [AS PER AMENDMENT 6/12/01: The Depo-Provera IM group in Step 2 is filled.

Step 1 (males and females): At entry, all patients are randomized to receive ZDV either orally or orally and intravenously (IV) on Days 7 and 8. Female patients begin the study (Day 0) between days 10-18 after the first day of their last menstrual period (LMP) (Cycle 1).

This study examines whether this combination therapy can reduce the number of HIV-infected cells hidden in the lymph nodes and blood.

Current anti-HIV drug treatments can greatly reduce the levels of HIV in the human body. However, HIV can hide in certain immune cells and escape the drugs' effects. Chemotherapy using CTX destroys these immune cells. When used with standard anti-HIV drug treatments, CTX may be able to speed up the elimination of HIV-infected cells.","HAART is a potent suppressor of plasma and lymph node HIV RNA. However, studies suggest that HAART cannot significantly diminish reservoirs of chronically HIV-infected cells. Strategies designed to eradicate all HIV infection should seek to actively target these reservoirs. CTX administration has been shown to eliminate a large number of lymphoid tissue T cells and macrophages, appearing to actively target chronically HIV-infected cells. As lymphoid organs are repopulated following initial depletion with CTX, HAART may protect repopulating cells from becoming HIV-infected, resulting in a net additional removal of the HIV-infected lymphoid reservoir.

Prior ACTG studies have shown that the 3-drug combination regimen (IDV/ZDV/3TC) resulted in improved clinical outcomes and therefore may prolong the effects of therapy. The enhanced effects seen with combination therapies are likely related to a greater suppression of RNA replication and alterations in resistance patterns. Due to the progressive success of combination regimens, it is possible that more potent regimens will further enhance viral suppression and provide more durable treatment responses. In light of the additive suppression of HIV replication determined by pharmacological, immunological, and virological results, nelfinavir (NFV) as an addition to IDV/ZDV/3TC will be evaluated.

These vaccines are called vCP205, vCP1433, and vCP1452. Some patients also receive another anti-HIV vaccine, gp160. The vaccines are made up of small pieces of HIV, which help the body learn to recognize and destroy HIV. You cannot get HIV from these vaccines.

There are two different ways a vaccine can protect the body from infection. First, a vaccine may help the immune system make antibodies, which are proteins that recognize invading viruses or bacteria. Second, a vaccine may help the body make immune cells that destroy infected cells. The second type of vaccine is more powerful against HIV. In this study, doctors will see whether vCP205, vCP1433, vCP1452, and gp160 are good vaccines by seeing whether they help the body make immune cells.","Previous studies in humans have shown that immunization with certain vaccine combinations (that is, ALVAC-HIV construct and an envelope subunit vaccine) can elicit CTL activity, antibody-dependent cellular toxicity (ADCC), neutralizing antibodies, and other antibody responses more often and at higher levels than either vaccine alone. This study examines improved vaccine candidates that can elicit broader, longer-lasting CTL activity in the majority of vaccine recipients.

Volunteers are randomized to one of four groups. Group I receives vCP205. Group II receives vCP1433. Group III receives vCP1452. Group IV receives an ALVAC rabies vaccine, as a control. Immunizations are administered at Months 0, 1, 3, and 6. At Months 3 and 6, patients in Groups I, II, and III also receive gp160 MN/LAI-2, the subunit boost vaccine.

The current therapies available to treat CMV retinitis are long-term therapies. However, it may be safe to stop long-term anti-CMV therapy in patients with healed CMV retinitis and stable CD4 counts resulting from taking a combination of at least 2 antiretroviral drugs.","This study proposes to assess the hypothesis that, in HIV-infected patients with treated and healed CMV retinitis, an increase in CD4+ T-cells after initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy is either directly related to, or a marker of, immunologic protection for CMV retinitis and is associated with a recovery in specific proliferation responses to CMV antigens.

In this study, 100 patients [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/2/99: 50 patients] with treated and healed, non-immediate sight-threatening CMV retinitis will discontinue maintenance therapy for suppression of CMV retinitis.

DMAC is a serious and sometimes life-threatening infection that usually affects only HIV-positive patients with CD4 cell counts (cells of the immune system that fight infection) less than 50 cells/mm3. It is recommended that people who are likely to get DMAC be placed on preventive medications which help reduce the risk of infection. New anti-HIV combination drug therapies can increase CD4 cell counts and can reduce the level of HIV in the blood. When CD4 counts are increased, risk of DMAC infection is less. This study examines whether it is possible to stop preventive therapy for DMAC when CD4 counts are high without placing individuals at risk for getting DMAC again.","A growing body of evidence suggests AIDS-related morbidity and mortality significantly decrease where potent antiretroviral therapies are used. HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) seems to significantly reduce the incidence of MAC. This study tests the validity of those observations.

This study will also determine if IL-2 given alone can increase CD4 cell counts or decrease the level of HIV in the blood.

IL-2 (a protein found in the blood that helps boost the immune system) can result in increases in CD4 cell count (immune system cells that fight infection). IL-2 is normally given in combination with antiretroviral therapy to treat HIV infection; however, some HIV patients do not wish to take antiretrovirals. This study asks if it is safe and effective to take IL-2 alone to treat HIV infection.","Previous studies have shown that interleukin-2, when given under the skin, results in CD4+ cell count increases, and may impact upon disease progression. A Phase III trial is the next step in the development of these efficacy trials. One question, however, has not been addressed in previous IL-2 studies: whether it is both safe and reasonable to allow prospective IL-2 recipients the autonomy of choosing whether or not to take antiretrovirals in addition to their cytokine therapy. This trial addresses that concern.

Primary HIV infection occurs within 20 days to 8 weeks following exposure to HIV. The symptoms of primary HIV infection are usually fever, tiredness, headache, or muscle aches. However, symptoms vary greatly from person to person, and some people might not experience any symptoms at all. Because these symptoms also resemble the cold or the flu, it is difficult to identify patients with primary HIV infection. Information gathered from this study will help doctors decide what kind of treatment is best to give patients who recently have been infected.","Primary HIV-1 infection is frequently identified as a nonspecific viral syndrome occurring within 20 days to 8 weeks following a documented HIV exposure. However, symptoms vary from person to person, and some people undergo asymptomatic seroconversion. Because of the difficulty identifying patients with either acute HIV infection (within 30 days of initial infection) or early infection (within 12 months of initial infection), no systematic review of viral dynamics or immunodynamics in this patient population has been undertaken. A better understanding of the virologic and immunologic parameters during acute and early HIV infection should provide information relevant to the optimal design of future clinical therapeutic trials.

The only patient intervention is obtaining blood, lymph node tissue, CSF, and semen or vaginal secretion specimens at designated intervals according to the schedule of evaluations. Patients are followed for 5 years. Patients may elect to start or discontinue antiretroviral therapy at any time; however, no antiretroviral therapy is administered as part of this study. Descriptive analysis includes tolerance and toxicity, magnitude and durability of RNA suppression, magnitude and durability of immunologic responses (CD4 and CD8 cells), and decay and emergence of resistant virus in tissue reservoirs (CSF, genital secretions, and lymph nodes).",Observational,"Inclusion Criteria

This study evaluates the safety of these drug combinations, which include an experimental protease inhibitor (PI), amprenavir.

Despite the success that many patients have had with PI treatment regimens, there is still a possibility that patients receiving PIs may continue to have high HIV blood levels. Because of this possibility, alternative drug combinations containing PIs are being studied. It appears that amprenavir, when taken with 3 or 4 other anti-HIV drugs, may be effective in patients with prior PI treatment experience.","A number of studies both within and outside the ACTG have been initiated or are in development to try to address the issue of alternative treatments for patients who either do not achieve or lose virologic control while receiving protease inhibitors (PIs). Amprenavir (APV) is an attractive candidate to investigate as part of salvage regimens because: 1) it has substantial antiretroviral activity; 2) there are preliminary in vitro and in vivo data that suggest that resistance to this agent may be mediated in part by a unique mutation (I50V); and 3) its cross-resistance profile to the approved PIs is uncertain.

Patients are selectively randomized to 1 of 4 study arms based on prior PI experience. Those randomized to Arms A, B, or C receive 2 PIs, 1 of which is amprenavir (APV), and those randomized to Arm D receive a single PI (APV) as part of their treatment regimen, as follows:

Arm A: APV plus saquinavir soft gel capsule (SQVsgc) plus abacavir (ABC) plus efavirenz (EFV) plus adefovir (ADV).

Researchers have found that combination anti-HIV therapy (multiple drugs given together) can help prevent AIDS-related illnesses and help people with AIDS live longer. In this study, the anti-HIV drug efavirenz (EFV) will be tested with 1 or 2 other protease inhibitors (PIs) to see which combination works best to treat HIV infection. EFV has been shown to limit the amount of HIV virus produced by infected cells.","Current recommendations for the initial treatment of HIV infection have centered on the reduction of plasma HIV levels.

Patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy with indinavir (IDV), zidovudine (ZDV)(or d4T) and lamivudine (3TC) show viral suppression for two years or more. Discontinuation of one or two of these drugs results in prompt loss of the viral suppression.

This blood may be used in the future to treat the child if he/she turns out to be HIV-positive.

Blood from the umbilical cord contains a certain kind of cell called a stem cell. Stem cells eventually turn into one of the many types of blood cells. If HIV infection can be prevented in these stem cells, then, when these stem cells are injected back into the infant, the new cells that develop will also be protected from HIV. This study will provide the blood needed to test whether this type of gene therapy is safe and effective.","Gene therapy may provide a new therapeutic approach to pediatric AIDS. Putting an HIV-resistant gene into umbilical cord blood stem cells and transplanting the cells back into the patient could lead to the production of cells that resist HIV infection. If a patient's cells could be engineered to be resistant to supporting the growth of HIV-1, the cells may have improved survival in the presence of HIV-1. To date, an umbilical cord blood bank for HIV-positive deliveries has not been established in the United States. This protocol establishes a repository of banked umbilical cord blood as a first step toward the potential application of gene therapy for the treatment of HIV-infected infants.

In order to determine the ability of a drug regimen to decrease viral load after drug treatment has failed, it is best to test a variety different of drug ""cocktails"" (drug regimens). The drug cocktails in this study include 2 new nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), efavirenz (an NNRTI, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor), and either 1 or 2 protease inhibitors. It is important to include multiple drugs from different groups in a drug cocktail since combinations containing fewer drugs are likely to fail.","To maximize the likelihood of a favorable response to salvage therapy, 4 or 5 drug regimens should be studied. Regimens containing fewer drugs, particularly those lacking a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) such as efavirenz, are likely to result in an unacceptable rate of virological failure.

Another purpose is to see what levels of SQV, low-dose RTV, ZDV, and 3TC are found in mothers and what levels of ZDV and 3TC are seen in newborns. Another purpose of this study is to see whether SQV passes from mother to newborn and if it passes at a level that is safe for the newborn.

Although ZDV has been able to reduce the rate of transmission of HIV from mother to child, it may be possible to reduce it further by using a combination of anti-HIV drugs. This study adds SQV (a protease inhibitor [PI]) with RTV (another PI) and 3TC (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) to the mother's ZDV regimen.","Although administration of ZDV to mother-infant pairs has dramatically reduced perinatal HIV infection, the goal is to reduce it further to less than 2%. In order to achieve this, combination strategies need to be developed for 2 purposes: 1) to reduce the perinatal transmission rate to goal levels; and 2) to provide other combination therapies for HIV-infected mothers whose virus has become resistant to ZDV, who have a very high viral load, or who have previously transmitted HIV while on ZDV.

Prednisone is a corticosteroid, a hormone produced by the body that inhibits immune cell responses. Prednisone may be able to lower the level of HIV in the body (viral load) by reducing the number of cells that HIV can infect. At the same time, prednisone may be able to increase CD4 cell counts (cells of the immune system that fight infection).","By inhibiting cellular activation, corticosteroids such as prednisone may inhibit HIV expression and reduce the population of potentially infectable cells. Furthermore, no studies have been performed to systematically evaluate immune function in prednisone-treated, HIV-infected patients or the immune mechanisms that may facilitate increases in CD4+ cell number. This study explores this issue.

This study will also examine which treatment regimen is best as a first treatment for HIV infection.","Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens containing PIs, NNRTIs, or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) have been shown to slow disease progression. However, the long-term consequences of initial therapy with a PI, an NNRTI, or both a PI and an NNRTI are not yet known, nor is the impact on future anti-HIV treatment regimens. Patients who experience virologic failure on a particular HAART regimen typically have not been studied for subsequent response to other HAART regimens. It is possible that a regimen which is initially the most potent may not be optimal if it limits the effectiveness of subsequent anti-HIV treatment regimens.

Patients will be randomized to one of three HAART treatment arms:

Arm 1 participants will receive one or two PIs plus two NRTIs.
Arm 2 participants will receive one NNRTI plus two NRTIs.

The purpose of this study is to see if IL-2 can increase the number of CD4 cells (cells of the immune system which fight infection) in HIV-infected patients who have completed ACTG 328.

HAART is often successful in decreasing viral load (level of HIV in the blood), but these drugs have not been able to restore the immune systems of HIV-infected patients. IL-2 is a substance naturally produced by the body's immune cells. In ACTG 328, IL-2 is tested to see if it can increase the number of CD4 cells and ""boost"" a patient's immune system. This study is a follow-up to ACTG 328 so that patients who are benefiting from IL-2 can continue to take it and patients in the control group who do not receive IL-2 can start taking it.","HIV disease is characterized by a progressive decline in CD4 cells and an increase in viral burden. Although antiretroviral therapy has been successful in controlling viral levels, its effects on CD4 cell counts have been modest. Intermittently administered IL-2 in the presence of HAART has been shown to increase CD4 cell counts, decrease lymphocyte activation markers, and increase certain lymphocyte functional activity in patients with early-stage HIV infection. ACTG 328 evaluated the effects of intravenous and/or subcutaneously administered IL-2 in conjunction with HAART in a group of more advanced HIV-infected patients over an 18- to 22-month period. As patients were enrolled in this study over an 18-month period, a follow-up protocol is required to provide continued IL-2 therapy for patients responding to IL-2 and patients in the control group who wish to receive this drug.

This study enrolls patients who participated in ACTG 328. Patients in Arm I of ACTG 328 (the control group receiving HAART only) who have a viral load of 5,000 copies/ml or less register for Step II. Patients in Step II receive subcutaneous [SC] IL-2 in combination with HAART. IL-2 is administered for 5 days every 8 weeks for the first 3 cycles. For subsequent cycles, the interval between cycles may be extended in 8-week increments for a maximum of 24 weeks, provided the patient's bimonthly CD4 count exceeds 500 cells/mm3. Patients in Arm I who have a viral load greater than 5,000 copies/ml register for Step I which requires a change in antiretroviral therapy. Patients who then achieve viral levels of 5,000 copies/ml or less may begin to receive IL-2 no earlier than 4 weeks and no later than 12 weeks after the change in HAART regimen. Patients whose viral load remains above 5,000 copies/ml for 12 weeks after the change in drug regimen are discontinued from the study. Patients in Arms II or III of ACTG 328 (IL-2-containing arms) who have had a 25 percent or greater increase in CD4 cell count above their Week 11 value and have a viral load of 5,000 copies/ml or less continue on SC IL-2 and HAART. Patients who meet the CD4 criteria but whose viral load is above 5,000 copies/ml change their HAART regimen. After a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 12 weeks, these patients may receive IL-2 provided they have a viral load of 5,000 copies/ml or less.

These drug combinations have been previously studied in adults, but there is limited information on how well they work in HIV-infected children. It is important to develop drug combinations which are effective at suppressing the HIV virus in children.","The use of combination therapy with 2 or more antiretroviral agents has been strongly supported by recent studies in both children and adults. However, as of yet, few combinations of antiretrovirals have been studied in large cohorts of stable HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral-experienced children. Evidence suggests that viral suppression may be more difficult to achieve in children. Therefore, it is important to develop new drug combinations which can maximally suppress plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations in children.

The protein eaten in foods (such as meat, eggs, or beans) may not be able to make up for the amount of protein lost due to HIV infection. This study gives patients high-quality protein food supplements to help them maintain and/or gain weight.","In many HIV-infected individuals with prior weight loss, the failure to regain weight and lean tissue is at least in part the consequence of inadequate protein intake or ingestion of a poor-quality protein rather than total caloric intake. Dietary sources of protein are presumably inadequate to meet the high metabolic needs caused by HIV infection. To achieve a target protein intake in the range (1.5 to 2.0 g/kg/day) demonstrated in other catabolic diseases necessary to achieve positive nitrogen balance and to generate substantial anabolic effects, this study will administer a supplement containing high-quality protein.

Two groups of 28 patients each are randomly chosen to receive either an oral nutritional supplement (Optimune) containing increased amounts of high-quality protein (whey), which is rich in cysteine and glutamine, or an isocaloric, identical-tasting supplement without added whey protein or amino acid supplementation. Weight, body composition, anthropometry, dietary intake, and general physical health are assessed at baseline and at Weeks 6 and 12.

Most of the people with HIV in the world today live in southern Africa. Because this population is not likely to use condoms, an HIV-prevention method that women can control is needed. N-9 used in the vagina may help prevent the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.","Intravaginal application of N-9 may help protect women from HIV and other STD infection. Low rates of condom use in sub-Saharan African populations, which constitute the majority of HIV infections, dictate the need for prophylactic methods women can control.

The Phase III trial is preceded by a 2-week safety and acceptability pilot study to determine the extent of genital irritation caused by N-9 and the placebo. Following the pilot study and prior to screening for enrollment in the Phase III trial, potential volunteers will participate in a 2-month behavioral counseling program that will encourage the use of condoms. Only participants who decide they cannot or will not be consistent condom users are enrolled in the main study.

Many new cases of HIV are the result of heterosexual activity. Condom use is currently the only effective way of preventing the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). However, women, who have a greater risk of getting HIV, are often unable to convince their partner to use a condom. Therefore, it is important to develop methods that prevent the spread of HIV and that are controlled by the woman, such as medicines used in the vagina. BufferGel is known to kill the organisms that cause STDs, including HIV. BufferGel may do this without causing genital irritation and sores as other medicines do. More studies are needed to see if this is true.","Heterosexual transmission of HIV presently accounts for the vast majority of new HIV infections worldwide. Currently the condom is the only method available that has been shown to be effective against HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). However, women who are at the greatest risk for acquiring HIV are often unable to negotiate condom use. Therefore, it is important that effective female-controlled barrier methods, such as topical microbicides, be made available to women. BufferGel has sufficient buffer capacity to acidify twice its own volume in human semen, which inactivates STD pathogens, including HIV. Unlike most other topical microbicides, BufferGel is non-detergent so it should not cause genital irritation and lesions. The safety and acceptability of BufferGel still need to be studied more carefully.

Participants are divided into two cohorts. Cohort IA consists of sexually abstinent women and cohort IB consists of sexually active women. Within each U.S. cohort, participants are assigned to apply BufferGel either once or twice daily. Within each international cohort, all participants apply BufferGel twice daily.

This study is designed to provide long-term monitoring of patients who have already received anti-HIV treatment as well as patients who are just beginning treatment or have decided not to receive treatment.","Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) often results in short-term benefits for people with HIV in terms of reduced plasma viral levels and increased CD4 cell counts. When used at an early stage of HIV disease, however, the clinical benefit of HAART is uncertain. Many questions still remain regarding the optimal use of antiretroviral therapies, such as the timing of initial antiretroviral therapy and the composition of the best combination regimen to use initially or after virologic failure. Randomized trials of different starting antiretroviral regimens (e.g., FIRST [CPCRA 058]), different regimens after initial virologic failure (e.g., PIP [CPCRA 057]), and different management strategies for HIV infection (e.g., bis-POM [CPCRA 039], NvR [CPCRA 042], GART [CPCRA 046], and IL-2 VL/Dose [CPCRA 059] are being conducted by the CPCRA.

The purpose of this study is to see if people who take azithromycin carry more antibiotic-resistant bacteria than people who have chosen to delay MAC preventive therapy.

When bacteria like Streptococcus (a type of bacteria that causes pneumonia and meningitis) are frequently exposed to antibiotics, the bacteria can become resistant to the drugs. MAC preventive therapy uses antibiotics, but this can make it difficult to treat other infections caused by bacteria that have become resistant in HIV-infected persons. If MAC preventive therapy is delayed, Streptococcus in the body may be less likely to develop resistance. Therefore, if the patient does get a Streptococcus infection, it will be easier to treat because it is not resistant to the antibiotics.","Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bacteremia, pneumonia, meningitis, and otitis media in the United States. Prior to 1987, this organism was uniformly susceptible to penicillin; since then, however, increasing numbers of isolates resistant to penicillin, as well as to other common antibiotics, have been identified. Frequent exposure to antibiotics has been documented as an important risk factor for the emergence of resistant organisms in HIV-infected patients, who are more likely than uninfected people to be colonized with antibiotic-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. This substudy is the first to examine the effects of withdrawing or delaying the initiation of prophylaxis (in this case, MAC prophylaxis) on the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci in a prospective manner.

Study participants are a subset of those enrolled in the CR-MAC Protocol (CPCRA 048).

Some ESRD patients are highly sensitive to certain transplant antigens (foreign substances that activate the immune system) and must wait for a long time before a well-matched kidney becomes available. Transplant rejection is more likely among highly sensitized patients than in patients who are not highly sensitized. There is no proven method to improve a highly-sensitized patient's chances of receiving and keeping a transplanted kidney.","Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

However, despite aggressive anti-rejection drug therapy, some patients will reject their new kidney. This study is designed to test two anti-rejection approaches. Two medications in this study are currently used in children, but there is no information regarding which drug is safer or more effective.

Survival rates in renal transplantation are unacceptably low. Therefore, there is a need for an improved post-transplant treatment, such as the induction therapy used in this study.","Renal transplantation is recognized as the treatment of choice for children with chronic renal failure. However, patient and graft survival rates in young children are unacceptably low. In preliminary studies, OKT3 (a monoclonal antibody) induction therapy received post transplant has been more successful than standard immunosuppression alone in improving graft survival. This study is designed to assess the impact of induction therapy on graft survival in pediatric kidney transplant patients.

Patients are assigned to OKT3 induction or no induction in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization to oral cyclosporine of either Sandimmune or Neoral is also done in a 1:1 ratio. Group 1 receives OKT3 intraoperatively followed by Neoral. Group 2 receives OKT3 intraoperatively followed by Sandimmune. OKT3 is administered at 2.5 mg (if weight less than 30 kg) or 5 mg (if weight above 30 kg) per day for a maximum of 14 days. Group 3 receives IV cyclosporine followed by Neoral. Group 4 receives IV cyclosporine followed by Sandimmune. Oral cyclosporine is administered in a masked preparation. The dose for Sandimmune and Neoral is the same; patients 6 years of age and older begin at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day and patients under 6 years of age receive 500 mg/m2/day. Patients will receive concomitant medications including steroids (IV and po), Nifedipine, anti-CMV therapy, Bactrim, Azathioprine or Mycophenolate Mofetil.

You will be assigned randomly (like tossing a coin) to 1 of 3 groups:

Group 1: Didanosine plus stavudine plus hydroxyurea (ddI/d4T/HU). Group 2: Didanosine plus stavudine plus efavirenz (ddI/d4T/EFV). Group 3: This group of patients will remain on their current drug regimens. This study will last approximately 3 years; you will receive study medications for the duration of the study.

Anti-HIV drug regimens that include protease inhibitors (PIs) are very good at lowering viral load. However, some patients have a rise in HIV levels while on PI maintenance. It may be possible to keep HIV levels low using another class of drugs for maintenance that are easier to take and less expensive than PIs. If viral load increases while a patient is taking this second group of drugs, it may be possible to restart the PI drug regimen and again decrease HIV levels.","Combination antiretroviral therapies using protease inhibitors (PIs) are capable of suppressing plasma HIV RNA to undetectable levels. However, approximately 10% of patients who achieve undetectable viral loads will experience a detectable rise in HIV RNA each year. When HIV replication has been suppressed to very low levels, it may be possible to consolidate antiretroviral therapy into a simpler and potentially less toxic ""maintenance"" regimen without a PI. Such a regimen would ideally be potent enough to continue to maintain viral suppression but use agents that are better tolerated, more easily salvaged, less expensive, and/or more convenient than PI-containing regimens. Subsequent rises in HIV viremia with non-PI maintenance regimens may respond to resumption of the pre-maintenance PI-containing regimen, extending the use of the potent PI class.

Patients are randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with ddI/d4T/HU (Arm A) versus ddI/d4T/EFV (Arm B) versus continuation of the pre-entry PI-containing regimen (Arm C). Viral load is measured at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24, then every 8 weeks for up to 3 years. Upon virologic failure (plasma HIV RNA greater than or equal to 200 copies/ml), or drug intolerance, patients on the maintenance regimens (Arms A and B) restart their pre-entry PI-containing regimen.

The study will also evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this anti-HIV drug combination.","Acute, primary HIV infection represents a potentially unique opportunity to eradicate the infection. Although plasma viral load rises rapidly, the dominant infecting virus is relatively uniform genetically, and infection may not be fully established in all tissue sites until some time after exposure. Current antiretroviral therapy is able to reduce plasma viral load to unmeasurable levels in established infection. However, there are many questions that remain about the treatment of primary HIV infection. While it is assumed that aggressive antiretroviral regimens are required, it is not known how long they must be continued. It is hoped that after an interval of aggressive therapy, the number of agents could be safely reduced. This study evaluates if viral suppression can be sustained after study therapy is withdrawn.

Participants in this study will receive lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), abacavir (ABC), amprenavir (APV), and ritonavir (RTV) for at least 52 weeks. During this induction phase, participants will be followed through regular study visits every 4 or 8 weeks. If the participant's viral load and CD4 counts are within study parameters at the end of 52 weeks, the participant will discontinue all antiretroviral medications simultaneously. Participants in the treatment interruption phase will be followed weekly initially, every 2 weeks for 8 weeks, and then every 4 or 8 weeks. Treatment may be restarted if necessary during this phase based on viral load and CD4 counts. If treatment is restarted, the participant will receive 3TC, d4T, APV, and RTV but not ABC. During this reinduction phase, participants will be followed every 4 or 8 weeks.

Depending on viral load and CD4 counts, participants may be eligible for a second treatment interruption phase following the reinduction phase. Participants will once again stop all antiretroviral medications simultaneously and will have the same monitoring as in the first treatment interruption phase. Following this second treatment interruption, participants will be restarted on 3TC, d4T, APV, and RTV and will be evaluated at Weeks 4, 8, 16, and 24, at which time participants go off study.

The three protease inhibitors given in this study are ritonavir, saquinavir, and nelfinavir. The lipid-lowering drugs given are pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin.

Anti-HIV drug therapy using protease inhibitors has become very common treatment for HIV-positive patients. Recently, however, serious side effects involving how the body uses fat have been reported in people taking protease inhibitors. Examples of these side effects are redistribution of body fat and development of diabetes. People taking protease inhibitors have been found to have higher levels of fat in their blood than is normal, which can cause heart problems. It is hoped that giving lipid-lowering drugs can help prevent serious heart problems. First, however, it is important to see what happens when protease inhibitors and lipid-lowering drugs are given together.","Potent antiretroviral therapy has become the standard of care for persons with HIV infection and AIDS. Recently, however, a number of complications have emerged with the widespread use of protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens, including: hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes mellitus, and lipodystrophy. Concern over the possibility of premature myocardial infarction has led health care providers and patients to consider treating these lipid metabolism disorders. Statin compounds have beneficial effects as lipid-lowering agents, and thereby reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications. Statin compounds such as pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin are increasingly being prescribed in persons taking PI-based potent antiretroviral therapy. It is important to determine whether there are significant drug-drug interactions between the statin compounds and PIs.

Fourteen healthy participants for each cohort of Arm A are stabilized on a fixed regimen of pravastatin (Arm A1), simvastatin (Arm A2), or atorvastatin (Arm A3) for 4 days. A baseline pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation is completed on Day 4. Pravastatin (or simvastatin or atorvastatin) dosing stops following the Day 4 dose and PK evaluation. On Day 5, a ritonavir and saquinavir combination regimen is initiated and continued through Day 18 of the study. Pravastatin (or simvastatin or atorvastatin) dosing resumes on Day 15 and continues through Day 18. A repeat PK evaluation of pravastatin (or simvastatin or atorvastatin) in the context of combination therapy is carried out on Day 18.

Fourteen healthy participants are assigned to Arm B; these participants begin a 2-week regimen of nelfinavir. On Day 14, a baseline PK profile of nelfinavir and its M8 metabolite is carried out.

Previous studies suggest that NVP is a promising medication for blocking HIV transmission from HIV-positive mothers to their babies.","NVP has several properties that make it an attractive candidate for antiretroviral therapy to interrupt HIV-1 transmission in the intrapartum and early post-partum period. The pharmacokinetic profile suggests that NVP would be rapidly absorbed and transferred to the infant in utero when given during labor and delivery. The HIV-1 antiviral activity is rapid with significant reduction in plasma virus occurring within a few days of drug administration. In addition, NVP has been shown to penetrate cell-free virions and inactivate virion-associated RT in situ. This property would be potentially useful in inactivating cell-free virions in the genital tract as well as in breast milk. These characteristics of NVP suggest that treatment of an HIV-infected pregnant woman in labor with an oral dose of NVP may provide a prophylactic level of NVP in the infant during the time of exposure to virus in the birth canal and/or maternal blood. In addition, NVP may inactivate the virion-associated RT present in cell-free virions in the genital tract or breast milk.

Mothers are randomized to receive either a single oral dose of NVP during labor or the corresponding NVP placebo. Randomization occurs at any time after the 28th week of gestation. To assure balance between the treatment groups, the randomization is stratified using 2 factors: 1) use of antiretroviral therapy during the current pregnancy (no antiretroviral therapy at all; monotherapy [with no multi-agent therapy] for any duration; multi-agent therapy for any duration), and 2) CD4 cell count at the time of randomization (less than 200 cells; 200 to 399 cells; 400 cells or greater). Mothers are followed on-study for 4 to 6 weeks postpartum.

Due to the results of ACTG 076 and 185, all women for entry into ACTG 316 are encouraged to incorporate a regimen of zidovudine (ZDV) into their current treatment regimen and should continue ZDV during delivery and to their neonates (for at least 6 weeks post-birth).

Infants receive a single oral dose of NVP (or the corresponding placebo) administered between 48 and 72 hours of life. The infant's study drug is the same as the mother's randomized treatment assignment. Infants are dosed with study drug according to their randomization group regardless of whether the mother received study drug or not.

This study involves patients who have received at least 60 weeks of anti-HIV therapy, either alone or in combination with IL-2, while enrolled in ACTG 328.

Remune is an experimental HIV vaccine. To see how the body's immune system reacts, this vaccine will be given with 1 to 3 other vaccines, and skin tests will monitor the body's reaction.","Proliferative responses to HIV antigens are either absent or of small magnitude in HIV-infected patients, even in the early stages of infection when vigorous proliferative responses to recall antigens are still seen. Remune consists of an inactivated, gp120-depleted virus intended to stimulate HIV-specific immune responses. Remune has been reported to increase lymphocyte proliferative responses to HIV antigens in patients with high CD4 cell counts. Many other T-cell-dependent responses are also impaired in HIV-infected patients, such as after vaccination with hepatitis A or B vaccine. In this study, patients with moderately advanced HIV disease who have already received 52 weeks of either HAART or HAART plus IL-2 are vaccinated with Remune and a control recall immunogen, tetanus toxoid (TT), to evaluate whether these patients can develop new CD4 T-cell and CD8 T-cell responses to HIV-related antigens. The antibody response to hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccinations also will be explored.

Fifty patients are enrolled in this substudy; 17 from the HAART only arm (Arm I of ACTG 328) and 33 from the HAART plus either CIV or subcutaneous IL-2 arms (Arms II and III of ACTG 328). All patients are vaccinated 3 times with Remune and twice with TT. If patients are hepatitis A total antibody negative, they receive hepatitis A vaccine twice. Additionally, if patients are hepatitis B surface antigen negative, hepatitis B core antibody and surface antibody negative, they receive hepatitis B vaccine 3 times. Patients who are negative for all hepatitis markers receive hepatitis A and B vaccines.

This study will also examine if this combination is well tolerated by HIV-positive pregnant women and if a combination of 3TC plus ZDV is safe for newborns.

Previous studies in adults and children have shown that indinavir plus 3TC plus ZDV can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood. Most HIV-positive pregnant women usually take ZDV to treat HIV and to reduce the chances of giving HIV to their babies. The combination of drugs in this study may be more effective than ZDV alone.","Despite the dramatic reduction of perinatal HIV transmission following the administration of ZDV to mothers and infants, new, more effective strategies are needed. An increasing number of women may require combination antiretroviral therapy for their own disease because they may be resistant to ZDV, may have high viral loads, or may have previously transmitted HIV to an infant while on ZDV monotherapy. The initiation of triple combination therapy, including a protease inhibitor indinavir, during gestation may be the most effective in reducing maternal virus load prior to delivery, thereby potentially benefitting both mother and child.

This study will look at whether it is safe to give these vaccines together and how the immune system responds to the vaccines.

There are a number of studies being performed to test HIV vaccines. The vaccines that seem to be the most promising are canarypox vaccines, known as ALVAC vaccines. The three experimental HIV vaccines used in this study are called ALVAC-HIV vCP205, HIV-1 SF-2 p24, and HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120. The HIV-1 SF-2 p24 and HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120 vaccines are mixed with an adjuvant, which is a substance that increases immune response.","There are currently several Phase I and II clinical trials being performed within AVEG to evaluate different HIV-1 vaccine candidates. The HIV-1 vaccination approach that is furthest along the clinical development pathway is the so-called prime-boost regimen of live recombinant canarypox priming (ALVAC-HIV vCP205) with recombinant subunit protein boosting (HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120 in MF59 adjuvant). The protein boost enhances neutralizing antibody responses against laboratory strains of HIV-1 in assays performed in vitro, as well as enhancing CD4 cell response and increasing the frequency of CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In all of the ALVAC-HIV trials of the prime-boost regimen completed to date, the protein boost has been the HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120 subunit protein. This study is designed to explore whether boosting of live recombinant canarypox vaccination with a novel protein subunit, recombinant HIV-1 SF-2 p24, can enhance the CD4 and CD8 cell responses directed against HIV-1 antigens.

Volunteers are randomized to 1 of 5 groups. All volunteers receive a total of 4 immunizations, administered at Months 0, 1, 3, and 6. Each group receives a different combination of vaccines as follows:

Group 1: ALVAC-HIV vCP205 plus HIV-1 SF-2 p24. Group 2: ALVAC-HIV vCP205 plus MF59 adjuvant and citrate vehicle (control for HIV-1 SF-2 p24 and HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120) at Months 0 and 1; then ALVAC-HIV vCP205 plus HIV-1 SF-2 p24 at months 3 and 6.

This study also examines the possibility of putting off MAC prevention treatment in patients who respond well to anti-HIV drug therapy.

Azithromycin is approved for the prevention of MAC disease in people with HIV and low CD4 cell counts. However, some people who have taken azithromycin have been found to carry antibiotic-resistant bacteria (germs that can grow despite the presence of drugs used to kill them). It is not known whether the risks associated with taking azithromycin outweigh the risk of getting MAC disease.","The need for MAC prophylaxis in advanced HIV disease is recognized. Prophylactic therapy is complicated, however, due to drug toxicity, potential drug interactions, patient noncompliance with multiagent regimens, microbial drug resistance, and high treatment costs. This study assesses the feasibility of deferring MAC prophylaxis in patients whose CD4+ cell counts rebound in response to antiretroviral therapy.

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients are randomized to receive azithromycin weekly or matching placebo.

Fluconazole is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs to treat thrush and other yeast infections. However, the number of patients with fluconazole-resistant thrush is increasing, and it is not known whether continuous or intermittent use of fluconazole leads to greater resistance. Therefore, it is important to determine the most effective treatment strategy.","This study will evaluate two different management strategies for patients with advanced HIV infection who are at risk for recurrent and fluconazole-refractory oropharyngeal candidiasis.

The molecular mechanism of the RT inhibitory effect is hypothesized to be non-competitive inhibition due to its binding to an RT site distinct from those for the RNA template primer, the deoxynucleotide triphosphate or the RNase H catalytic site.

This is a staggered dose escalation cohort trial which examines the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics and activity of Nevirapine (BI-RG-587) in patients with HIV infection. Groups of 10 patients must have completed 4 weeks of therapy without requiring dose interruption before the next dosage level can be initiated. All 10 patients must be enrolled at a lower dosage level before the next dosage level can be initiated. Patients discontinue antiretroviral therapy, after signing informed consent, 28 days prior to receipt of a first dose of Nevirapine. Screening lab tests, including p24 antigen and plasma viremia, and CD4+ cell count determination are performed 21 days prior to drug dosing in Part I. Patients are notified of screening laboratory measures that exclude them from study participation. Upon such notification patients have the option to resume prior antiretroviral therapy or to repeat those values in one week. Part II consists of two 8-hour intensive blood sampling periods plus frequent trough value blood samplings. Safety, trough value blood sampling, and activity assessments are performed in Part III. An assessment of dose-tolerance and of activity is made in Study Week 12 in order that patients may continue Nevirapine chronic therapy for an additional 12 weeks. The Final Visit in Part IV takes place on Study Week 24 to complete the trial. Patients who complete 24 weeks are offered the option to continue on Nevirapine chronic therapy at the initial or an altered dose on a separate open-label protocol.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria

Additional objectives are to examine the effect of these treatments in controlling time to cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis progression and to examine the antiviral activity of combined and alternating ganciclovir/foscarnet treatment and development of antiviral resistance. Sight-threatening CMV retinitis occurs in at least 6 percent of AIDS patients. By 1991 (US), there may be 6000 to 10000 patients with CMV retinitis. Many clinical reports suggest that both ganciclovir (DHPG) and foscarnet have an antiviral effect against CMV that is often associated with clinical stabilization. Effectiveness of ganciclovir and foscarnet is correlated with weekly maintenance and since toxicity is dose-limiting in up to 20 percent of patients receiving either drug for long periods, it may be beneficial in long-term maintenance treatment to combine or alternate these two drugs at a lower total weekly dose of each drug.

This strategy may result in a greater net antiviral effect with less toxicity than is seen with either drug alone, because the toxicities of each drug are quite different.","Sight-threatening CMV retinitis occurs in at least 6 percent of AIDS patients.

Treatment of AIDS has been directed toward the underlying retroviral infection as well as toward specific opportunistic infections and malignancies that are associated with the syndrome. The most extensively studied drugs are reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as AZT and other nucleoside analogs, including didanosine (ddI) and dideoxycytidine (ddC). The most extensive clinical experience has been achieved with AZT. These clinical trials indicated a decreased incidence of opportunistic infection and increased survival in patients with AIDS. However, AZT treatment is associated with dose-limiting toxicities.

AMENDED: Previously, rCD4-IgG had been administered on a mcg/kg basis. Subjects now receive rCD4-IgG as a fixed dose. Changes to the maintenance schedule were made to accommodate the new dosages. Original design: This study is divided into two parts: A pharmacokinetic evaluation, and a safety evaluation. The pharmacokinetic evaluation is done in selected patients. For the safety evaluation patients will receive rCD4-IgG at a fixed dose level twice weekly by intravenous bolus injection (over 1 minute) for 12 weeks. Zidovudine (AZT) is administered orally 3 times daily at one of two dose levels. Eight subjects, at least 4 of whom with p24 levels greater than 75 pg/m, are entered at each dose level of CD4-IgG beginning with dose level 1. If 3 or more patients at a dose level experience grade 3 or 4 toxicity then no further patients will be added to that or higher dose levels. Pharmacokinetics of CD4-IgG alone and in combination with AZT is evaluated in patients at dose level 2 only.

AMENDED: To assess whether didanosine (ddI) will be better tolerated than AZT administered by either continuous intravenous delivery or oral administration (ddI arm removed per amended version).To determine whether ddI will achieve comparable clinical efficacy as the continuous intravenous route of delivery of AZT, and to assess whether either or both of these regimens are superior to that achieved with an intermittent AZT dosage schedule. To determine whether there are differences in patient or parent (guardian) compliance between the three treatment regimens. Original design: To determine whether the pharmacokinetic profile (bloodstream levels) of zidovudine (AZT) influences its effectiveness on HIV infection in children. That is, the study seeks to find out whether there is a difference in the effect of AZT when given as a continuous intravenous infusion (and, if available, an oral sustained release dose) compared to an intermittent (not continuous) dose given orally every 6 hours. The study also plans to determine (1) whether there are differences in the tolerance and side effects associated with AZT when given on an intermittent schedule as opposed to a steady-state schedule; (2) the extent of variation from patient to patient in AZT levels and whether the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of AZT are related to the degree of therapeutic effectiveness; and (3) whether there are differences in the response of children who acquired HIV infection perinatally (just before, during, or just after the time of birth) versus those who acquired HIV infection by transfusion.

One of the most serious effects of HIV disease in children is neuropsychological deterioration (relating to mental and nervous system functioning). This complication affects the vast majority of HIV infected children. A previous study of continuous intravenous administration of AZT in pediatric patients with HIV infection showed consistent and dramatic improvements of symptoms in all patients that had shown neurodevelopmental deficits or abnormalities. These improvements were seen within 3 to 4 weeks after AZT treatment was started. Neurodevelopmental improvements have been sustained on AZT, usually showing steady improvement which, in some patients, was associated with restoration of pre-HIV intellectual and neurological function. This study also showed an increase in the IQ scores of children receiving continuous infusion of AZT who did not have overt clinical evidence of encephalopathy (disease of the brain). Thus changes in cognitive function may be among the earliest signs of AIDS encephalopathy and underscores the need to start therapies that will treat the central nervous system in patients who appear to be clinically intact. A study comparing continuous infusion to intermittent dosing of AZT showed a significant increase in IQ scores for those children receiving the continuous dose compared to those treated with the intermittent schedule. Although a portable infusion pump allows patients to receive continuous infusion of AZT, a sustained release oral formulation that could provide a continuous release of AZT into the bloodstream would be highly desirable.","One of the most serious effects of HIV disease in children is neuropsychological deterioration (relating to mental and nervous system functioning).

Thus changes in cognitive function may be among the earliest signs of AIDS encephalopathy and underscores the need to start therapies that will treat the central nervous system in patients who appear to be clinically intact. A study comparing continuous infusion to intermittent dosing of AZT showed a significant increase in IQ scores for those children receiving the continuous dose compared to those treated with the intermittent schedule. Although a portable infusion pump allows patients to receive continuous infusion of AZT, a sustained release oral formulation that could provide a continuous release of AZT into the bloodstream would be highly desirable.

AMENDED 07/07/93: Children with progressive encephalopathy who have received a minimum of 3 months of oral or intermittent AZT or who have failed to improve following 6 months of optimal AZT will receive continuous infusion AZT via a portable infusion pump.

AMENDED: The oral sustained release has been dropped and is now oral ddI. Added has been a planned stratification for randomization for patients who received any antiretroviral therapy 4 or more weeks prior to study entry. The informed consent was modified to reflect ddI toxicities from adult studies. Computerized Tomography radiation dosimetry is now included.

AMENDED: Dropping the ddI component and open only to children with encephalopathy meaning they are losing milestones, this is equal to a P2 CDC rating . Testing the difference in intermediate vs continuous AZT. 12/1990. Original design: Children are first evaluated for randomization according to whether they have or do not have evidence of neurodevelopmental deficits at the time of the initial pretreatment evaluation. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups, to receive AZT (1) by continuous infusion; (2) by oral, intermittent (every 6 hours) dosing; or (3) by oral sustained-release dosing. If the oral sustained-release formulation is not available when this study begins, it will begin with only the first 2 groups. The sustained release preparation will be evaluated as soon as it is available. Patients will be tested to measure physical or biological improvement in neurodevelopmental function.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria

Other goals are to evaluate and compare the degree of change in neurodevelopmental disease and determine whether there are differences in the rate and degree of toxicities associated with one versus the other dosage.

AZT has been shown to decrease the death rate and frequency of opportunistic infections in certain adult patients with symptomatic HIV infection. Thus, it is likely that symptomatic HIV infected children may also benefit from AZT. Studies of the safety and pharmacokinetics (blood levels) in children have indicated that AZT can be given to children in doses that can be tolerated and that can be assumed to be therapeutic. Those currently taking care of infected children no longer feel it is ethical to conduct an AZT/placebo (inactive substance) trial.

To establish an appropriate dosage regimen of d4T to be employed in Phase II and III trials. To evaluate the effects of de-escalating doses of d4T on markers associated with HIV infection.

Currently, the only FDA-approved therapy for patients with AIDS or ARC is zidovudine (AZT), a drug with significant value but limited use because of toxic effects on the bone marrow. d4T has not been tested in humans, but it has inhibited the reproduction of HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) in laboratory experiments.

In some studies with laboratory animals, d4T was less toxic against blood cells than AZT.

A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been found in Phase I trials to date. An MED will be determined. The daily dose of d4T is divided into 2 portions and administered approximately 12 hours apart for 10 weeks. 5 patients receive the initial dose level and successive groups of 5 patients enter the study at a lower dose level once 3 patients in the preceding group have successfully completed at least 3 weeks of dosing and shown a positive effect on CD4 cell count and p24 antigen levels. The initial group of patients continue dosing at their dose level for an additional 94 weeks as long as they are doing well as measured by p24 antigen levels and CD4 cell counts. The dose de-escalation scheme continues until a lack of efficacy is seen in 2 of 5 patients in any group. Patients are assigned to de-escalating dose level treatment groups in the order in which they are enrolled. Blood and urine samples are taken regularly to check for toxic effects and therapeutic effectiveness.

Original design: To determine if granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) is helpful in preventing the decreased numbers of white blood cells (infection-fighting cells) associated with ganciclovir ( DHPG ) therapy and to determine if GM-CSF can be safely used in AIDS patients with cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) retinitis.

AMENDED: In ACTG 004, among 11 AIDS patients with CMV infection receiving DHPG maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg, 5x/week) with stable white blood cells (WBC)/absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) 7 (64 percent) required dose reduction or discontinuation of both antiviral medications due to granulocytopenia when AZT (600 mg/day) was added. A mean nadir ANC of 717 cells/ml was reached at a mean of 5 weeks of concomitant DHPG/AZT therapy in these patients. While recovery of depressed ANC occurred following discontinuation of study medications, progressive CMV infection (most commonly retinitis) occurred in 19 of 40 patients and seemed to be associated with DHPG therapy interruption. Only 3 of 40 patients were able to tolerate the complete 16 week study duration of DHPG/AZT. Pharmacokinetic studies of co-administration of DHPG and AZT revealed no significant drug-drug interactions. The study investigators concluded that the main, treatment limiting toxicity of combination DHPG/AZT therapy is granulocytopenia and that many patients treated on this study developed intercurrent OIs or staphylococcal septicemia. In order to determine whether patients receiving maintenance DHPG therapy with or without GM-CSF can tolerate concomitant AZT therapy, extended maintenance therapy with the assigned study regimen in combination with AZT will be incorporated into this protocol. Original design: CMV infection causes inflammation of the retina and can lead to permanent blindness. Treatment for CMV retinitis with DHPG has been shown to be effective in halting the progression of retinal disease. During DHPG treatment, however, about 30 to 55 percent of patients develop decreased white blood cell counts. GM-CSF, a naturally occurring human hormone, stimulates the body's bone marrow to produce more white blood cells. Studies with GM-CSF in AIDS patients have shown that it can significantly increase depressed white blood cell counts in these patients.","AMENDED: In ACTG 004, among 11 AIDS patients with CMV infection receiving DHPG maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg, 5x/week) with stable white blood cells (WBC)/absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) 7 (64 percent) required dose reduction or discontinuation of both antiviral medications due to granulocytopenia when AZT (600 mg/day) was added.

AMENDED: Following completion of Phase A, study participants may elect to extend their assigned maintenance therapy (DHPG alone or DHPG/GM-CSF) in combination with AZT therapy (Phase B). GM-CSF dosing will be titrated as above to maintain a target ANC of 2500-5000 cells/mm3.

It is hoped that this drug will prevent children from developing additional symptoms and infections and will help resolve already existing symptoms.

AZT has been shown in the laboratory to inhibit the infection of cells by HIV. AZT has been shown to decrease the mortality and the frequency of opportunistic infections in certain adult patients with symptomatic HIV infection.

Approximately 4 weeks after patients in ACTG 021 and ACTG 081 have begun PEN aerosol therapy for the prevention of PCP, patients undergo the first radioactive aerosol study. The patient inhales a mist while sitting with his/her back against a gamma camera. The resulting picture outlines the lungs. This mist contains a single dose of PEN mixed with a small amount of radioactivity (99m-technetium ertechnetate). The gamma camera determines where the particles deposit in the lungs. The radioactivity exposure is equivalent to a typical xray of the ribs. This procedure takes about 45 minutes; 6 hours later another 30-minute gamma camera image is obtained. Blood is withdrawn to measure the blood level of PEN as done in ACTG 021 and ACTG 081.

Original design: To evaluate the short-term effects of combined administration of zidovudine (AZT) and increasing doses of recombinant interleukin-2 (aldesleukin; IL-2) in patients infected with HIV, who have lymphadenopathy, but who are otherwise asymptomatic (no other symptoms). The first phase of this clinical trial will establish maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ). How quickly the drugs get into the blood and how long they remain there (pharmacokinetics) will also be studied at each dose as well as the effect on HIV.

Since AZT has no effect on cells that contain inactive virus (latently infected cells) and these cells may act as viral reservoirs, that a second agent that can destroy these infected cells would be useful in combination with AZT. The different activities of AZT and IL-2, as well as the non-overlapping nature of their mechanisms of action and toxicity, increase the theoretical benefits of combining AZT, a drug which has clinically significant activity in HIV-related disease but cannot eliminate infected cells, with IL-2, a drug which may enhance anti-HIV immunity, destroy chronically infected cells, and allow immune recognition of latently infected cells.","Since AZT has no effect on cells that contain inactive virus (latently infected cells) and these cells may act as viral reservoirs, that a second agent that can destroy these infected cells would be useful in combination with AZT.

Five patients who have already received and tolerated oral AZT for at least 8 weeks continue their AZT treatment and at the same time receive IL-2 on a schedule of 5 days on the drug, 2 days off the drug. The IL-2 is administered by 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion according to this schedule for 4 weeks. The first week of IL-2 treatment is on an inpatient basis and the remaining 3 weeks are on an outpatient basis. Toxicity is monitored every week. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the maximum dose at which 3 out of 5 patients experience Grade 3 or above toxicity during the course of IL-2 administration. A second cohort of five patients will receive IV IL-2. If the MTD is not reached, five additional patients will receive IV IL-2. All five patients in a given cohort must complete a full 4-week course of IL-2 before subsequent patients are entered at the next higher dose level. After IV dosing is completed at these three levels, additional 5-patient cohorts receive subcutaneous (SC) IL-2 according to the same schedule. Each patient is restricted to one dosage group.

As of August 31, 1989, 437 patients were enrolled into uncontrolled studies of trimetrexate for PCP:214 in TX 301/ACTG 0=039 (trimetrexate for patients intolerant of approved therapies) and 223 in NS 401 (trimetrexate for patients refractory to approved therapies). The analysis of overall response rate, stringently defined as having received at least 14 days of trimetrexate and being alive at follow-up 1 month after the completion of therapy, reveals 84/159 intolerant patients and 48/160 refractory patients had responded, for rates of 53 percent and 30 percent, respectively. These response rates include all individuals who received at least one dose of trimetrexate. Of the 111 patients who were ventilator-dependent at study entry, 18 completed a course of therapy and were alive a month later, for a response rate of 16 percent. All other ventilated patients died.

Cryptococcal meningitis is a life-threatening infectious complication of AIDS. Because relapse after treatment occurs in over 50 percent of cases, chronic maintenance therapy with intravenous (IV) amphotericin B is usually given. However, amphotericin B is not always effective, has toxic effects, and must be given by the intravenous route. Fluconazole is an antifungal agent that can be given orally and has been shown to be effective against cryptococcal infections in animals and against acute CM in a few AIDS patients. Also, the side effects experienced by over 2000 patients or volunteers given fluconazole have seldom been severe enough to require withdrawal of the drug.","Cryptococcal meningitis is a life-threatening infectious complication of AIDS.

SECONDARY: To evaluate toxicity, biological markers, and patient management in the two arms.

Although changing therapies is a common strategy in the treatment of HIV disease, guidelines are needed to help clinicians and patients decide when a change in antiretroviral therapy is indicated. The technology of measuring HIV RNA in plasma has been suggested as a tool for monitoring clinical drug efficacy. However, uncertainty remains about whether aggressive antiretroviral treatment to lower HIV RNA and maintain low levels for as long as possible will confer clinical benefit in comparison with management based on monitoring CD4 counts and HIV-related symptoms.","Although changing therapies is a common strategy in the treatment of HIV disease, guidelines are needed to help clinicians and patients decide when a change in antiretroviral therapy is indicated.

Cervical tumors are found in both HIV-infected and HIV-negative women. However, HIV-infected women are at a greater risk, and often their tumors become cancerous more quickly than those in HIV-negative women. Isotretinoin may be able to prevent this from happening. However, since these tumors tend to disappear over time, many doctors are hesitant to give their patients isotretinoin since this drug causes birth defects. This study looks at whether it is better to treat cervical tumors in HIV-infected women or to wait and see if they will disappear by themselves.","Cervical neoplasia is frequently seen in HIV-infected women, apparently resulting from immunosuppression and common risk factors, including sexual behavior patterns. In HIV seronegative women, progression of preinvasive neoplasia is relatively slow, and up to 40 percent of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (grade I CIN/HPV-associated changes) regress to a normal appearance over time. Many clinicians have opted not to treat CIN I/HPV-associated changes due to this high spontaneous regression rate. Currently, retinoids, principally isotretinoin, are the most consistently effective medical therapy for CIN/HPV-associated changes, but use of isotretinoin in HIV-infected patients has not been extensively documented.

Children have been receiving medications to prevent complications of HIV infection, such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease, or other bacterial infections. It is common for HIV-positive patients with low CD4 counts to receive these preventive medications. However, these drugs can have serious side effects, they are expensive, and it is possible for bacteria resistant to the drugs to grow. For these reasons, it may be beneficial to the child to stop taking these preventive medications if he/she has been on anti-HIV (antiretroviral) therapy and has improved CD4 counts. This study will look at how many children who stop taking their medications develop opportunistic infections.","Due to the strong correlation between a significant decrease in CD4 count and the frequency and magnitude of OIs such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), and severe bacterial infections, CD4 count has become the major criterion for initiating antimicrobial prophylaxis for OIs. However, despite the benefits of these antimicrobial drugs, all are associated with adverse side effects, and patients with reconstituted immune systems following antiretroviral therapy may be receiving prophylaxis unnecessarily. Benefits to stopping prophylaxis include: (1) elimination of adverse effects from drugs; (2) reduction in drug costs; and (3) removal of selective pressure for the development of drug-resistant microbes. These benefits must be weighed against the disadvantages, however, such as more frequent determinations of CD4 counts to assure maintenance of immunocompetence, more frequent occurrence of serious OIs otherwise preventable with prophylaxis in patients lost to follow-up, and possible occurrence of atypical PCP because of prior exposure to anti-PCP drugs. [AS PER AMENDMENT 04/26/02: The extent of complete immune restitution has not yet been defined. An important corollary of an incomplete immune recovery is that vaccination schedules might need to be adjusted to obtain optimal responses in HIV-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Therefore, a third dose of hepatitis A virus vaccine will be administered.]

After pre-entry and entry laboratory studies, patients are followed every 8 weeks until the last patient has completed 104 weeks of study observation. Hepatitis A vaccination is administered at entry and Week 24 to measure responses to neoantigen. [AS PER AMENDMENT 04/26/02: All patients (except those co-enrolled in P1024 on or after November 1, 2001) who have received 2 doses of hepatitis A virus vaccine during the study will be offered an opportunity to enroll in Step II of P1008. Patients in Step II receive a third dose of hepatitis A vaccination at Week 104 or later. Additional blood samples are taken 8 weeks later for antibody detection and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cryopreservation.] All serious bacterial infections that are Grade 3 or higher and OI events are recorded and compared to historical event rates. Virologic and immunologic marker studies are done in all patients and correlated with the risk of developing serious bacterial infections or OI events. Patients are considered to have reached an endpoint if they develop PCP, 2 serious bacterial infections, other Category C OI diagnoses, or CD4% less than 15% and re-initiation of PCP prophylaxis.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria

Body wasting is an increasingly frequent AIDS-defining condition in individuals infected with HIV. Increasing caloric intake fails to consistently restore lean tissue patients with HIV associated weight loss. Megestrol acetate has been shown to stimulate appetite and weight gain in subjects with cancer and in those with HIV associated weight loss. However, the weight gained during treatment with megestrol acetate was predominantly or exclusively fat. An important factor is the preferential increase in body fat seen in both of these studies may have been due to hypogonadism that occurs as a result of treatment with megestrol acetate, a progestational agent. Hypogonadism is associated with an increase in body fat and a decrease in LBM. Concomitant testosterone replacement should substantially increase the amount of LBM accrued during megestrol acetate therapy. This study will determine whether anabolic potential can be realized when caloric intake is increased in the absence of concomitant hypogonadism.","Body wasting is an increasingly frequent AIDS-defining condition in individuals infected with HIV.

The Master PRAM is a Phase II, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial of a standard therapeutic regimen in current use versus experimental therapies administered over 48 weeks. It is designed to allow new therapeutic arms to be studied as ""rolling screens"" through multiple generations of PRAM. Each PRAM generation compares 2 novel therapeutic arms with a linking arm that allows for an indirect comparison of included therapies. Once accrual to PRAM-1 is complete a new treatment comparison opens for accrual (PRAM-2). The linking arm to be used in PRAM-2 is decided by the Pediatric Primary Scientific Committee. PRAM-2 will continue to accrue patients while PRAM-1 patients continue therapy.

For PRAM-1: This study compares the following three treatment arms:

Arm I: ZDV plus 3TC Arm II: d4T plus ritonavir Arm III: ZDV plus 3TC plus ritonavir. Prior to randomization to one of the three arms, patients are stratified based on CD4 percents: either less than 15% or greater than or equal to 15%.

The objective of antiretroviral therapy is to reduce HIV replication, preserve immunologic function and delay the development of HIV-related complications. In patients administered potent antiretroviral regimens, HIV RNA levels are reduced below 500 copies/ml of plasma and below the level of detection of commercially available assays. This protocol attempts to learn if a less intensive regimen can successfully sustain viral suppression after induction with a triple-drug regimen. The study also addresses whether HIV can be eradicated in patients following prolonged treatment with induction and maintenance regimens.","The objective of antiretroviral therapy is to reduce HIV replication, preserve immunologic function and delay the development of HIV-related complications.

This protocol attempts to learn if a less intensive regimen can successfully sustain viral suppression after induction with a triple-drug regimen. The study also addresses whether HIV can be eradicated in patients following prolonged treatment with induction and maintenance regimens.

All patients will receive open label induction therapy with zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC) and indinavir (IDV) for 6 months. Following the 6 month induction phase, patients with undetectable plasma HIV RNA at weeks 16, 20 and 24 will enter the maintenance phase [blinded maintenance phase AS PER AMENDMENT 09/19/97] and be randomized to one of three maintenance regimens, i.e., either continued ZDV/3TC/IDV (control), or ZDV/3TC/IDV placebo or ZDV placebo/3TC placebo/IDV. Prior to randomization, patients are stratified according to entry HIV RNA level (greater than or equal to 30,000 or less than 30,000 copies/ml) and by prior ZDV therapy (at least 7 days or less than 7 days). After 12 months [AS PER AMENDMENT 09/19/97: 18 months] of maintenance therapy, treatment will be withdrawn at 6-month intervals in randomly-selected patients who have achieved undetectable HIV RNA. AS PER 09/19/97 AMENDMENT: After 18 months of blinded maintenance therapy, treatment is unblinded for patients whose HIV RNA levels remain detectable. Such patients receive optimal therapy, either continuing the protocol regimen or initiating alternative therapy.

AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/98: An interim review conducted in January, 1998 demonstrated that the strategy of less intensive antiviral therapy after 6 months of IDV/3TC/ZDV induction therapy is less effective than continuation of triple drug therapy except for ZDV-naive patients assigned to ZDV/3TC. Therefore, the maintenance phase of this study has been discontinued.

Patients currently on blinded maintenance are unblinded immediately and have the option of reinitiating open-label triple therapy with IDV/3TC/ZDV or discontinuing study treatment. Patients currently on induction may register for continued open-label triple therapy or may discontinue study treatment. This amendment allows treatment extension so that subjects may receive open-label triple therapy until May 31, 1998. At that time, a rollover protocol or another modification with a longer period of drug supply may become available. Patients who choose to go off treatment are followed until May 31, 1998.

To look at the absolute change in HIV blood levels from the beginning of the study to Week 16. To look at the safety and tolerability of nelfinavir (NFV) and efavirenz (EFV) when used in combination or separately in regimens containing reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs). For the 2 extension studies (Weeks 49 to 144): To look at the proportion of patients whose long-term viral load remains undetectable at Week 96.

To assess safety, toxicity, and tolerance of salvage study drug treatment. (This study has been changed by adding new objectives.) Achieving viral suppression has been widely endorsed as the primary goal of HIV therapy. However, there are few established guidelines for devising combinations of different classes of drugs which will enhance the potential for achieving viral suppression, reducing the risk of toxicity, and preserving therapeutic options for future use. This study includes 2 anti-HIV drugs, NFV (a protease inhibitor [PI]) and EFV (a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]), for use either alone or in combination with RTI therapy for the purpose of limiting HIV replication.

The new RTI, adefovir dipivoxil, is added to the 2-drug PI regimen to achieve suppression of viral replication and thereby delay disease progression. (This rationale reflects a change in the treatment given to patients with treatment failure at Week 16.)","Achieving viral suppression has been widely endorsed as the primary goal of HIV therapy, yet there are few established guidelines to provide the framework by which to devise combinations of different classes of drugs which will not only enhance the potential for achieving viral suppression while reducing the risk of toxicity but will also preserve therapeutic options for future use. This study includes 2 antiretroviral compounds, NFV (a protease inhibitor [PI]) and EFV (a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI]), for use either alone or in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) therapy for the purpose of limiting HIV replication. [AS PER AMENDMENT 3/5/98: Patients who experience treatment failure at Week 16 or later choose 1 of the following alternative potent salvage therapy regimens: a dual-PI regimen (saquinavir/ritonavir) plus adefovir dipivoxil and L-carnitine; EFV or NFV (if not already given) plus 2 new approved antiretroviral drugs outside the study; or the best available treatment outside the study. The new reverse transcriptase inhibitor, adefovir dipivoxil, is added to the dual-PI regimen to achieve suppression of viral replication and thereby delay disease progression.]

Further intent of this study is to evaluate the virologic and therapeutic potential of novel combinations of antiretrovirals and to better define the pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of therapies included in this regimen.

(NOTE: Due to significant changes in study design between PRAM 1 and PRAM 2, there is no ""linking"" arm between them. The linkage will be reinstated from PRAM 2 and subsequent PRAM generations.)

This study will also look at the strength of the immune systems of patients with early HIV infection.

Because HIV multiplies very quickly in the early stages of infection, patients with early HIV infection may be more likely to transmit HIV to their partners. The amount of HIV in blood, genital fluid, and saliva may determine the risk for transmission.","Persons with early HIV infection may represent high transmission risk to their partners. Early infection, characterized by rapid virologic replication, insufficient immunologic control of infection, and more rapid course of disease progression, may be associated with increased infectiousness. The viral determinants of transmission may in part be explained by viral burden in blood, genital fluids, and oral cavity fluids. All three fluids may be the source for transmitted virus.

Past studies have shown that combination therapies not only will result in better clinical outcomes but may prolong the effects of therapy. The enhanced effects seen with combination therapies are likely related to a greater suppression of HIV replication and alterations in resistance patterns. Both in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that triple-drug therapy may have an advantage over one- and two-drug regimens. Therefore, triple-drug therapy appears to be an important strategy in the treatment of HIV infection.","Past studies have shown that combination therapies not only will result in better clinical outcomes but may prolong the effects of therapy.

HIV infection weakens the immune system's ability to fight other infections and diseases. HAART is a type of anti-HIV therapy shown to improve the immune system of adults. However, not all patients show the same amount of improvement with HAART. Doctors believe that results may depend on how strong a patient's immune system is before starting HAART. Long-term effects of HAART in children and young adults have not yet been studied.","Recent adult clinical trials involving combination HAART, including a protease inhibitor (PI), have demonstrated improvements in somatic immune system functioning. [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01: More recently, similar success has been demonstrated with a PI-sparing regimen, zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz.] Not all individuals, however, experience the same level of immune reconstitution, and oftentimes any improvement is short-lived. Adolescent patients may have a greater potential for immune restoration because of residual thymic tissue and therefore may experience greater long-term virus-free states as compared to adult patients. This study examines the duration of virologic efficacy HAART has on the adolescent HIV-positive population.

Patients begin study by initiating a HAART regimen of a minimum of 3 drugs, at least 1 of which must be a PI [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01: or efavirenz (EFV)]. A variety of drug combinations are used; therefore, patients are grouped according to the classes of drugs in their respective regimen (e.g., 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] plus 1 PI; 2 NRTIs plus 2 PIs; 1 or 2 NRTIs plus 1 PI plus 1 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI] [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01: ; and 2 NRTIs plus EFV]). At the time of HAART initiation, patients undergo immunologic and virologic assessments in order to determine baseline values. Then, to determine the virologic success or failure of HAART, HIV-1 RNA measurements are taken and compared to initial baseline values. Virologic success equals undetectable HIV-1 RNA at Week 12 [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01: and confirmed at Week 16] or a significant (greater than 1 log) decrease in HIV-1 RNA from baseline to Week 12 [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01: and confirmed undetectable HIV-1 RNA before the next scheduled visit (Week 24)]. Patients are followed for a minimum of 3 years of maintained viral suppression or until they have demonstrated virologic failure. From these values, any correlation that may exist between HIV-1 RNA values and HAART can be deduced. Patients with virologic failure on the initial HAART regimen may be allowed to change to a second HAART regimen. [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01: Patients with virologic success on the second HAART regimen are followed for a minimum of 3 years.] Patients with virologic failure on the second HAART regimen or who voluntarily discontinue HAART are followed using an abbreviated schedule for 3 years.",Observational,"Inclusion Criteria

This study will evaluate patients who are enrolled in CPCRA 058 (the FIRST [Flexible Initial Retrovirus Suppressive Therapies] study) by looking for changes in cholesterol levels, levels of fat in the blood, and body fat distribution. Patients in the FIRST study receive an anti-HIV drug regimen which contains a protease inhibitor (PI), a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or both.

Anti-HIV drug therapy using PIs has become very common treatment for HIV-positive patients. Recently, however, serious side effects involving how the body uses fat are being reported in patients taking PIs. Examples of these side effects are a redistribution of body fat, high cholesterol level, and development of diabetes. However, some of these side effects have also been seen in patients who are not taking PIs. It is important to determine whether or not these side effects are directly related to PI use. In this study, patients on different drug combinations, either with or without a PI, will be compared.","Close to 3 years into widespread PI use, several toxicities, including metabolic alterations, are being reported increasingly in conjunction with the use of PI-containing regimens. Some of the manifestations of these metabolic alterations include hyper/dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, lipodystrophy (in face and extremities), and body fat redistribution (e.g., central obesity and buffalo humps). Despite reports of increasing prevalence of metabolic complications among PI users, the question of whether they result from PI therapy has not been answered. Some of these complications, e.g., a decrease in peripheral fat with an increase in visceral fat and buffalo hump, have been observed in HIV-infected individuals who were not receiving PIs. This study compares 3 different antiretroviral regimens used in the FIRST study (CPCRA 058), 1 of which does not contain a PI, and examines metabolic alterations which occur.

This study enrolls patients simultaneously co-enrolling in the FIRST protocol; 120 patients from each of the FIRST study strategy groups. At entry, Months 1 and 4, and then every 4 months, blood is drawn to measure serum glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. At entry and Months 4, 8, 12, and then every 12 months, body cell mass, and body fat by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) are assessed. [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/5/01: At Months 4, 8, and 12, then every 4 months through closure of the FIRST protocol] patients are weighed and skinfold measurements and body circumference measurements are done.

CSF is the fluid found around the brain and spinal cord. This study also looks at whether reducing HIV in the CSF can help protect brain function.

HIV can be detected in the brain and CSF early in HIV disease. Anti-HIV drugs probably reduce HIV in the CSF. This may be important because other studies have suggested high CSF HIV levels may lead to some loss of brain function.","HIV-1 RNA emerges in CSF early in the course of HIV disease. Studies have shown that high levels of HIV-1 RNA in CSF correlate with increased severity of dementia and worsened performance on neuropsychological tests. While combination antiretroviral treatments are potent suppressors of HIV-1 replication in plasma, the extent to which these treatments suppress viral replication in CSF is unknown. A few studies suggest that antiretroviral treatments can reduce HIV-1 RNA in CSF. However, since CSF is isolated from peripheral immune responses to HIV and antiretroviral treatment may not readily penetrate the compartment, researchers hypothesize the remaining virus will overcome the antiretroviral treatment to achieve high levels of viral replication again. This virologic failure is likely accompanied by decreased cognitive function. It is therefore critical to determine the ability of antiretroviral treatments to control HIV-1 replication in the CSF and the durability of that viral suppression.

Patients enrolling in one of several AACTG-sponsored potent antiretroviral therapy trials (a ""parent"" trial) may enter this study. [AS PER AMENDMENT 06/06/00: Patients already enrolled in an AACTG-sponsored study who are changing treatment due to virologic failure may also enter this study.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 11/15/01: Patients starting a new potent antiretroviral regimen as part of their clinical care, enrolling in a potent antiretroviral treatment trial, or changing potent antiretroviral therapy in clinical care or in an ongoing antiretroviral treatment trial because of virologic failure may enter this study.] Patients receive no treatment but undergo various procedures aimed at characterizing the effects of antiretroviral therapies on CSF viral load and cognitive function. Procedures include: 1) venipuncture to measure plasma HIV-1 RNA and DNA levels, CD4+ T cell count, and cytokine and immune activation markers associated with HIV-1 neurological disorders; 2) neuropsychological examinations to measure cognitive function; and 3) lumbar punctures to obtain CSF samples, which are used to determine the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral agents in CSF and to determine levels of blood cells, cytokine and immune activation markers, and HIV-1 RNA and DNA. An entry visit must occur before initiating potent antiretroviral therapy in the parent trial [AS PER AMENDMENT 06/06/00: or before changing the antiretroviral regimen due to virologic failure in an ongoing trial].

The major clinical question is whether patients who receive chronic ZDV therapy will have a delay in the development of AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC). The pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of ZDV in hemophilic patients will also be studied.

Study B: To determine if ZDV therapy changes the risk of a hemophiliac transmitting HIV to his wife or other female sexual partner. To determine the effectiveness of counseling and education on the behaviors of the wives that place them at risk for HIV infection. To determine if antibodies to HIV either appear or disappear from the blood of any of the wives during the study.

Study A: Individuals who are infected with HIV can benefit from therapy with an effective anti-AIDS virus agent. ZDV is a potent inhibitor of HIV in vitro (test tube) and is safe in humans at the dose planned. It may be effective in preventing the development of AIDS or ARC in hemophiliacs who have the HIV antibody in their blood. The pharmacokinetic studies are especially important because the high prevalence of hepatic disease in this population may affect the metabolism and blood levels of ZDV.

Study B: HIV is transmitted by sexual contact, and wives of infected hemophilic patients have become infected during long-term sexual relationships. Transmission of the virus does not occur during casual family contact. This study will aid in determining if therapy influences the transmission of HIV, because the wives of hemophiliacs generally have no risk for HIV infection other than sexual contact with their spouse.","Study A: Individuals who are infected with HIV can benefit from therapy with an effective anti-AIDS virus agent.

Study A: Patients selected for the study are randomly assigned to placebo (inactive medication) or ZDV taken every 4 hours while the patient is awake for a total of 5 doses per day. The patient's immune function and clinical condition are monitored with periodic virus cultures, p24 antigen assays, estimates of lymphocyte type and numbers, cell surface markers, and frequent clinical evaluations to see if these are markers of drug efficacy. Patients continue on their regimen until the final analysis of the data, which could occur up to 3 years after the last patient is entered into the study. Amendment: Based on data from ACTG 019 this protocol has been closed to further accrual. All patients entered in this study will be unblinded as to treatment received. Patients will be informed of results of ACTG 019 and be requested to sign a modified statement of consent approved by the local Institutional Review Board. All patients currently receiving study therapy will be offered open-label ZDV. Patients temporarily discontinued from study therapy at this time will be offered open-label ZDV when toxicity resolves (less than or equal to Grade 2 hemoglobin or neutrophil toxicity, less than or equal to Grade 1 all other toxicities). Patients who have been permanently discontinued from study therapy will not be eligible for open-label ZDV through this protocol. Modification of dose is recommended, however, patients who elect to continue current dose of ZDV after being informed of results of ACTG 019 will be allowed to do so. All patients enrolled in this study will continue to be followed until termination of this study. Above amendment added 11/01/89.

Study B: The wife or other female sexual partner is interviewed once at the beginning of the study and again when Study A is completed. The interview takes about 10 minutes and includes questions about the couple's sexual activity to help define the risk of becoming infected with HIV. In addition, blood is drawn to test for antibodies to HIV. The questionnaire and blood sample will be repeated at the time the patient is switched from blinded study therapy to open-label ZDV. (AMENDED 11/01/89) The results of the blood test are given to the person being tested. Information about the transmission of HIV and counseling are provided. It is recommended that the wife abstain from sexual contact with her husband, but if she does not, the use of condoms or condoms plus a spermicide is recommended.

Original design: To determine the distribution and elimination of zidovudine (AZT) in the body as well as its safety in the treatment of pregnant women and their unborn children. The information derived from this study is required in order to design a future study that will assess the efficacy of AZT in reducing the transmission rate of HIV-1 from seropositive women to their fetus by treating them during the third trimester of pregnancy.

An estimated 30 percent to 40 percent infected pregnant women risk transmission of HIV-1 to their infants, whether they be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Zidovudine (AZT) has previously demonstrated its effectiveness as a potent inhibitor of HIV replication in vitro and in adult patients; benefits of treatment include decreased mortality rate, decreased incidence of opportunistic infections, and increased number of CD4 cells. Phase I AZT studies in children, however, have resulted in uncontrolled information regarding clinical efficacy. The present study, therefore, will investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) and oral AZT administration to HIV-1 infected pregnant women in the 3rd trimester, as well as the safety and efficacy of such treatment in their newborns.

The study will also see what effect taking several anti-HIV drugs together at high doses has on the body's ability to fight HIV infection. The 7 drugs that will be given in this study are stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), lamivudine (3TC), nelfinavir (NFV), ritonavir (RTV), saquinavir (SQV), and nevirapine (NVP).

(This study has been changed from an 8-drug regimen to a 7-drug regimen. Patients no longer receive the drug hydroxyurea [HU].) Doctors are seeing many HIV-positive children who did not get good long-term results from the current anti-HIV drugs. Some doctors believe anti-HIV drugs fail because drug levels in the body are too low. In this study, doctors will give patients 7 drugs, some at higher doses than normal. Since it is very important that patients on the study take all of these drugs, doctors will make it as easy as possible. Doctors want to try this because children with advanced AIDS have few treatment choices.","Clinicians are increasingly confronted with HIV-positive children who have failed all available antiretroviral therapies and have few viable treatment options. Virologic failure in these patients may be a result of antiretroviral resistance, likely a result of poor adherence to the treatment regimen or inadequate dosing.

Treatment with more than 4 drugs has not been studied formally in children, but pediatricians caring for children with AIDS have used such strategies off study with success. Dose intensification may also aid in overcoming resistance; therefore, in this trial, d4T, 3TC, and NFV are administered at up to twice their standard doses. Given the limited therapeutic options available to HIV-positive children with poor prognoses, high-dose, multi-drug therapy merits study.

Because children's bodies are still developing, their cells are different from those of adults, and their bodies respond differently to infections such as HIV. In order to understand how immune cells grow and mature so that they can fight HIV, it is important to see how these cells behave in normal children.","Early in life, the cells involved in immune selection differentiate into CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Currently there is insufficient information on the cell maturation and activation of these peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subsets in normal children. The critical need for this information has been brought about by the pediatric HIV/AIDS epidemic, which requires the measurement of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells and other cells types for interpretation of HIV disease progression. The immunopathogenesis of pediatric HIV infection differs from that in adults but is not well understood. In order to better understand HIV disease progression in HIV-infected children, these PBMC subsets must be studied in normal children so that control values can be established.

Healthy infants, children, and adolescents presenting for routine care or elective surgery have a single blood sample obtained. Blood is used for complete blood count, peripheral blood mononuclear cell flow analysis for surface markers, and plasma and cell storage. Demographic information including age, sex, race, and ethnicity is obtained at the time of the blood draw. The reason for the patient's visit is also documented. No study drugs are administered or supplied as part of this study. Statistical analysis is used to estimate the median distribution of each CD4 and CD8 subset.",Observational,"Inclusion Criteria

429827,NCT00001110,ACTG 723,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),NIH,Effect of Anti-HIV Therapy (HAART) on HIV Levels in the Lungs and on Lung Cell Inflammation in HIV-Infected Patients,July 2013,Completed,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),NIH,"The purpose of this study is to see: (1) how the amount of HIV in the lungs compares to that in the blood; (2) if HAART reduces the amount of HIV in the lungs; and (3) if HAART reduces lung inflammation in HIV-infected patients.

Lung-cell inflammation in HIV-infected patients is probably caused by HIV infection of these cells. The amount of inflammation may correspond to the amount of HIV (viral load) in the lungs (i.e., mild inflammation indicates a low amount of HIV; severe inflammation indicates a high amount of HIV). HAART is used to decrease the amount of HIV in the body. If HAART is able to decrease viral load in the lungs, it should also be able to decrease lung-cell inflammation in these patients.","Lymphocytic alveolitis in HIV-infected patients probably represents a local immune response to HIV-infected cells in the lung. The intensity of lymphocytic alveolitis may therefore reflect the viral load in the lung. If so, treatment that reduces viral load in the lung (e.g., HAART) should also decrease the number of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the alveolar space and should return pulmonary immune responses toward normal.

Patients are stratified by CD4 count: less than 200 cells/mm3 or 200 - 500 cells/mm3. BAL is performed and blood samples are collected prior to initiation of HAART and after 1 and 6 months of HAART. If a patient has detectable HIV in the lung after 6 months of HAART, the patient is asked to submit to an optional fourth BAL after 12 months of HAART. BAL fluid and cells are analyzed for HIV viral load, percent lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets. Responses in the lung are compared to simultaneous changes in these variables found in the peripheral blood. Each patient serves as his/her own control.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria

This study will also examine the effect of TNFR:Fc on TNF-alpha. IL-6 and TNF-alpha are 2 substances produced by the immune system that may increase the rate of HIV replication.

IL-6 and TNF-alpha are produced naturally by the body. High levels of TNF-alpha lead to increased IL-6 production and increased HIV replication, therefore helping the virus infect the body. HIV-positive patients who receive IL-2 (interleukin-2, a protein that helps the immune system fight infection) tend to have higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha than patients not receiving IL-2. These increased levels may contribute to some of the flu-like symptoms related to IL-2 administration. TNFR:Fc can neutralize TNF-alpha to decrease the action of TNF-alpha and, in turn, decrease the amount of IL-6 in the body. TNFR:Fc may, therefore, have a role in the treatment of HIV disease or in relieving some of the symptoms related to IL-2 administration.","Both Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are substances naturally produced by the body's immune system. Evidence suggests that TNF-alpha production may be excessive or inappropriate in HIV-infected patients. Elevated TNF-alpha levels can result in increased IL-6 production and possibly increased HIV replication. TNFR:Fc is a modification of a natural substance that binds to TNF-alpha and neutralizes its activity. It is postulated that TNFR:Fc may result in decreased activity of TNF-alpha and lower IL-6 levels. HIV-infected patients who receive Interleukin-2 (IL-2) have been shown to have higher TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels than those who do not receive IL-2. It is thought that these higher levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 may contribute to some of the flu-like symptoms experienced by patients receiving IL-2.

T-20, unlike other anti-HIV medications, lessens the ability of HIV to infect certain cells (T cells) in the body. Doctors hope to better treat HIV by adding T-20 to anti-HIV drug combinations that include 1 or 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and/or a protease inhibitor (PI).","T-20 is the first drug to be developed which specifically inhibits the function of the gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein. By inhibiting the essential protein-protein surface interaction, T-20 is able to block the process of virus-to-host cell membrane fusion. Combination antiretroviral regimens (reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus PIs) have benefited many HIV patients, but heavily pretreated patients often develop multi-drug resistance via multiple gene mutations. A pharmacologic agent, such as T-20, that is effective at an alternative point in the virus replication cycle will make a valuable addition to the treatment of HIV infection.

This Phase I/II open-label, dose-escalating, randomized study is divided into 2 parts. Patients may participate in Part A and/or Part B. Part A (single dosing): 12 patients are sequentially assigned to receive 1 of 3 doses of T-20 given once on Day 0 by SC injection into the abdomen, deltoid area, or anterior aspect of the thigh and once on Day 1 by IV infusion. Provided safety criteria are met, patients who complete Part A, or new enrollees who did not participate in Part A, enroll in Part B. Doses for Part B are determined by pharmacokinetic data obtained in Part A. [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/20/00: Current data has now projected a pediatric dose. Each child will move to chronic dosing in Part B provided the child has no Grade 3 or higher toxicity to study drug through Day 7 in Part A.] Part B (multiple dosing): Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 3 dose cohorts to receive 24 weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/7/00: 48 weeks] of treatment (optional extension to 48 weeks [AS PER AMENDMENT 12/7/00: 96 weeks]) with bid SC injections of T-20. Cohort 1 receives the dose identified in Part A (Dose 1) as the lowest dose that is well tolerated and that achieves the target trough plasma concentration. Cohort 2 receives the next higher dose from Dose 1 (Dose 2). Cohort 3 receives either Dose 1 or Dose 2, depending on the tolerability and antiviral activity of each dose. [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/20/00: Cohort 1 receives 30 mg/m2 SC bid (Dose 1); Cohort 2 receives 60 mg/m2 SC bid (Dose 2); and Cohort 3 receives Dose 1 or 2 SC bid.] On Day 7 of T-20 dosing, children begin a new antiretroviral therapy regimen chosen by the site investigator based on study parameters.

Doctors generally treat patients in the early stages of HIV infection with the same anti-HIV drugs taken by patients who have had HIV for a long time. These drugs lower the level of HIV in the blood. However, doctors do not know whether patients who take anti-HIV drugs in the early stages of HIV infection actually live longer or have fewer AIDS-related diseases. This study will help doctors answer these questions. In the main study, doctors will look at how 2 different anti-HIV drug combinations affect the immune system. In the 2 substudies, doctors will look at how the body reacts to the hepatitis B vaccine and the tetanus vaccine. These substudies may help doctors learn how HIV-infected patients respond to new infections.","Current treatment guidelines recommend combination ART for acute primary HIV-1 infection. However, it is not known whether ART given during acute infection delays progression to AIDS or improves survival rates. Preliminary studies suggest ART given early in HIV infection not only reduces viral load but also restricts CD4+ cell loss, delays the development of opportunistic infections, and preserves T-helper cells and naive T cells. The immunologic basis of these protective effects has not been characterized thoroughly. This protocol assesses ART's effects on immune responses in early HIV infection through a variety of cellular, humoral, and virologic assays, including 2 substudies. The substudies focus on antibody responses to neoantigen immunization (hepatitis B and tetanus). Primary endpoint analysis occurs at Week 72, but patients may be followed for long-term outcomes.

In the main study, patients with HIV-1 infection of less than 120 days are given the option of taking a potent ART combination of abacavir (ABC), efavirenz (EFV), indinavir (IDV), and lamivudine (3TC) for 96 weeks. [AS PER AMENDMENT 9/15/00: Patients choose either Regimen 1: ABC, 3TC, IDV, and ritonavir (RTV) or Regimen 2: ABC, 3TC, and EFV.] Patients who decline treatment provide a concurrent, non-randomized comparison group. These patients may choose to be considered for study treatment at any time or to start antiretrovirals provided through another source. [AS PER AMENDMENT 9/15/00: If a patient who initially does not start therapy subsequently starts antiretroviral therapy provided by the study (within the 120-day limit), the visit schedule is re-set.] During the treatment period, all patients undergo regular physical exams and blood tests to characterize T cells, viral resistance, antibody responses, and other markers. Patients presenting within 30 days of HIV-1 infection undergo leukapheresis (where available) prior to starting ART. At Month 12, these patients and all untreated patients undergo leukapheresis to assess the proportion of latently infected CD4+ T cells. In addition, all patients in the main study and patients in 2 comparison groups (Cohorts A and B) participate in 1 of 2 substudies of antibody responses to neoantigen. Volunteers are recruited to 2 cohorts to serve as controls. Cohort A volunteers have established HIV-1 infection. Cohort B volunteers are HIV-1 seronegative but at high risk for HIV. In the first substudy, hepatitis B-seronegative patients from the main study and from Cohorts A and B receive hepatitis B vaccine at Weeks 40, 44, and 64 and undergo humoral and cellular response assessments at Week 68. In the second substudy, patients from the main study and from Cohorts A and B who did not qualify for the hepatitis B vaccination undergo intramuscular vaccination with tetanus toxoid at Week 64 and immune responses are assessed at Week 68.

Cancer is a leading cause of death in AIDS patients. Common cancers in HIV-infected patients include Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), a cancer of the immune system. Risk factors include certain chemicals, viruses, and perhaps even anti-HIV drugs. Doctors would like to find out which risk factors are most important and how they relate to cancer in AIDS patients.","AIDS-associated malignancy represents a model system for investigations of carcinogenesis. There are few human conditions in which cancer rates are of the magnitude they are in HIV infection. While studies have investigated pre-cancer markers in HIV-infected patients, they have not correlated these markers with tumor samples. This study contributes to understanding oncogenesis of HIV-associated malignancies by establishing a collection of tumors linked with pre-cancer sera and lymphocyte specimens, as well as prospective questionnaire data.

At study entry, patients receive a comprehensive physical exam. Clinic staff interview the patient to collect data regarding medication history (particularly antiretroviral exposure), diet, occupational history, substance abuse, and sexual practices. This information is used to identify behavioral and environmental factors contributing to oncogenesis. In addition, baseline blood samples are analyzed for HHV-8 and EBV levels, anti-EBV and anti-HHV-8 antibodies, CD23, Th2 cytokines, tumor growth factors, chromosomal translocations associated with NHL, and other potential predictors of malignancy. At Month 6 and annually thereafter, patient records are abstracted for data on vital status, AIDS-defining illnesses, medications, and most recent CD4+ T cell and HIV RNA levels. At Years 1, 2, and 3, patients undergo physical exams and blood tests for malignancy surveillance. Any malignancies are biopsied and analyzed for oncogene identification and virology.

Doctors need to look at how these patients respond to HIV infection in order to develop new HIV vaccines and other treatments for HIV and AIDS.

Patients who receive HIV vaccines are sometimes protected from HIV infection. More often, these patients become HIV-positive but experience a boost in their immune system that helps their bodies fight HIV. Doctors need to look at how these patients respond to HIV infection in order to develop new HIV vaccines and other treatments for HIV and AIDS.","There are many possible outcomes of HIV-1 infection among persons who receive experimental HIV-1 vaccines. In the best-case scenario, these vaccines may prevent infection (sterilizing immunity). However, current viral vaccines are thought to limit, but not prevent, virus replication after infection. In the latter case, it is important to document the effect of the immune response on the disease course as reflected by viral load, the evolution of the viral quasi species, and clinical symptoms over time. Understanding the evolution of the immune response in vaccinees after subsequent exposure and HIV infection will potentially result in valuable information for the subsequent design of preventive and therapeutic vaccines. This will be studied here using HIVNET 014 participants at higher risk for HIV-1 infection.

Observed therapy means that a nurse will watch patients take their medications to make sure that they take them correctly.

It is very important that HIV-positive patients take their anti-HIV medications correctly so they get the best possible benefit from them. Taking the drugs correctly, called ""adherence,"" may keep HIV virus levels in the blood (viral load) low for a longer time. Adherence can also slow the development of drug resistance, and this is especially important in patients with early HIV infection who are just beginning treatment. However, anti-HIV medication schedules are often complicated, and many patients have difficulty remembering to take their drugs at the correct time. This study will look at the effectiveness of a plan to help patients with this problem.","Novel approaches are needed to improve adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy. Nonadherence can lead to reduced drug levels and inadequate viral suppression, which accelerates drug resistance. Thus nonadherence in the first few months of primary HIV infection can limit therapeutic options for an individual years later. Barriers to optimal treatment adherence in patients with early HIV infection include complex treatment regimens which disrupt daily routines, drug intolerance, and concomitant illness including depression. Directly observed therapy has been successful in improving overall effectiveness of antituberculosis therapy and may be a useful strategy in HIV-infected patients.

VZV is the virus that causes chickenpox. If this virus is reactivated in the body, it can also cause shingles. Shingles is common in children with HIV who have had chickenpox, although it is usually not life-threatening. The VZV vaccine used in this study may be able to prevent HIV-positive children who have had chickenpox from developing shingles.","Varicella (chickenpox) results from primary infection with VZV. Varicella, a common and usually benign illness in normal children, is more severe in HIV-infected children and may result in other conditions such as HZ (shingles). HZ is due to reactivation of latent VZV acquired during varicella and is common in HIV-infected children who have had natural varicella. While HZ is not likely to be life-threatening in these children, it does cause considerable morbidity and interferes with quality of life. Use of a live-attenuated VZV vaccine may be able to boost immunity in these children.

Two immunologic cohorts are enrolled. Cohort A includes children with a CD4 cell percentage greater than or equal to 20 percent that has been documented as stable for at least the 6 months prior to the time varicella developed (confirmed by a minimum of 2 tests) and a CD4 cell percentage greater than [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/27/99: or equal to] 15 percent that has been documented as stable for at least the 6 months prior to enrollment (confirmed by a minimum of 2 tests).

[AS PER AMENDMENT 10/27/99: If 3 children in the pilot study for Cohort A meet a toxicity endpoint deemed to be related to the vaccine, the dose regimen has failed safety criteria for both cohorts. If 3 children in the pilot phase of Cohort B meet a toxicity endpoint deemed related to the vaccine, the dose regimen has failed the safety criteria for Cohort B.] If, at 12 weeks after immunization, at least 5 pilot-study patients in a cohort respond and the safety profile is deemed adequate, the pilot study extends into a full study with the immunization of an additional 20 patients from that cohort. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/27/99: If, at Week 12, at least 5 pilot-study patients in Cohort A meet immunologic criteria and the safety profile is deemed adequate, then the full study for Cohort A and the pilot study for Cohort B opens.

Doctors would like to find out if the combination of IL-12, paromomycin, and azithromycin is more effective than paromomycin and azithromycin alone.

Cryptosporidiosis is a type of opportunistic (AIDS-related) infection seen in HIV-positive patients as their immune systems weaken. It is caused by a parasite that invades the intestinal tract, and it can cause watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, an upset stomach, or a fever. Antibiotics (paromomycin and azithromycin) are usually used to treat cryptosporidiosis. In this study, doctors will look at the effectiveness of using IL-12. IL-12 is a type of protein naturally produced by certain types of cells of the immune system and is believed to be important for immune function. Doctors hope that IL-12 can help boost the immune system in fighting cryptosporidiosis.","Cryptosporidium parvum, an intracellular protozoan parasite, is a frequent cause of chronic diarrhea in HIV-infected patients, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Highly effective antiparasitic treatment for this infection is not currently available. Paromomycin and azithromycin have some efficacy and have been used in combination in a small number of patients. Immune reconstitution with highly active antiretroviral therapy appears to be the most effective therapy, but this is not possible for all patients. Interferon gamma expression is strongly associated with control of cryptosporidiosis, and IL-12 is the cytokine primarily responsible for stimulation of interferon gamma expression in vivo. It is hoped that treatment with recombinant human IL-12 can result in stimulation of an intestinal cytokine response in AIDS patients with cryptosporidiosis and that response combined with chemotherapy can lead to the elimination of detectable numbers of Cryptosporidium oocysts from the stools.

All patients receive azithromycin and paromomycin, and patients are randomized to add either IL-12 or placebo. IL-12 (or placebo) injections are given twice a week. Patients take their study medications for 4 weeks. During this time, they will be asked to record bowel movements and any symptoms they experience. Patients return to the clinic at least twice a week to receive IL-12 (or placebo) injections. At Weeks 2 and 4, patients are seen by one of the principal investigators. Blood samples are obtained for viral load measurements and CD4 count, as well as routine urinalysis.

It is very important that HIV-positive patients take their anti-HIV medications correctly so they get the best possible benefit from them. Taking the drugs correctly, called ""adherence,"" may keep HIV virus levels in the blood (viral load) low for a longer time. However, anti-HIV medication schedules are often complicated, and many patients have difficulty remembering to take their drugs at the correct time. This study will look at 2 different ways to teach patients about the importance of taking their medications correctly and to remind them when to take their medications.","Adherence to antiretroviral (AR) therapy has become increasingly important in the management of HIV infection. Adherence to AR regimens is thought to be a critical factor in maintaining therapeutic drug levels, thus helping ensure viral suppression and minimizing the risk of drug resistance. However, AR regimens are often complex with demanding dosing schedules. Patients often miss doses because they simply forget; other factors such as substance abuse, depression, and low literacy levels also contribute to nonadherence. Adherence is influenced not only by individual behavior but also by the services, the quality of the patient-provider relationship, and the amount of social support offered the patient. There is no currently agreed upon, widely used, and generalizable intervention for improving adherence over the long course of HIV therapy. This study provides a long-term comparative evaluation of two interventions.

Clinical sites, rather than individual patients, are randomized to one of four groups: a medication manager, an electronic medication reminder system, a medication manager plus an electronic medication reminder system, or usual care. Special training sessions are held for the staff of participating units assigned to medication manager and/or electronic medication reminder system interventions. The medication manager is a research staff member who works individually with study patients, addressing the knowledge, motivation, and skills necessary for adherence. The electronic medication reminder system is ALR (A Little Reminder). This is a small, portable alarm that is programmed to sound and flash at the times of the patient's scheduled AR medication doses. Patients enrolling into either the FIRST or MDR-HIV study at clinical sites authorized to carry out this study are offered the option of participating in the adherence intervention to which the clinical site has been randomly assigned. Data collected through the FIRST and the MDR-HIV protocols are used to address the Adherence study objectives. Patients on the FIRST protocol are assessed for time to first plasma HIV-RNA level above 2,000 copies/ml. Also, patients on the FIRST and MDR-HIV studies are assessed for changes in viral load, resistance, CD4 cell counts, adherence, and other factors.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria

Patients who have been infected with HIV recently may develop flu-like symptoms within 3 to 8 weeks. Those who go to the hospital emergency room for these symptoms and who may have been exposed to HIV recently will be given a questionnaire and the opportunity to be tested for HIV.

Most people develop flu-like symptoms shortly after becoming infected with HIV, and many of these people go to a hospital emergency room for treatment. However, most doctors do not think of testing people with flu-like symptoms for HIV. This study will look at a plan to change this because it is very important to identify patients who have early HIV infection. Viral load (level of HIV in the blood) is very high during early HIV infection, and it is easy to spread HIV to others during this period. Patients who learn they are HIV-positive can stop risky behavior that might spread HIV to other people. Also, patients who find out early that they are HIV positive are able to begin anti-HIV treatment sooner, slowing the disease.","Early identification of HIV infection is an important factor in preventing the spread of HIV. It is hoped that patients who learn their HIV status will decrease behavior that may lead to further transmission of HIV. Infectiousness of HIV is high during PHI, with some of the highest viral loads seen shortly after infection. Treatment for HIV infection now typically begins after identification of infection, but treatment during PHI may positively affect the long-term outcome of the disease. The majority of patients present with flu-like symptoms during PHI. Many seek medical attention, often in an ED setting, but rarely is the diagnosis of HIV considered. Specific screening efforts, therefore, are needed to identify infected individuals before standard ELISA testing would detect infection. This study attempts to demonstrate that administration of a questionnaire to a targeted population presenting symptomatically with viral syndrome in an inner city ED will result in increased screening for HIV and identification of patients with PHI.

Patients presenting to the UCSD ED with viral syndromes are approached by staff and asked to complete a questionnaire regarding possible recent HIV exposure. Patients with risk for recent HIV infection are offered participation in this study. Pre-test counseling includes a review of: (1) the risk of discrimination if the test is positive, (2) the implications of a positive test upon the health of the patient and that of their sexual or needle-use partners, and (3) the possibility that this test, like any laboratory test, could be wrong. Consenting patients have blood drawn for HIV RNA testing and for possible HIV p24 antigen confirmatory test. Blood is labeled with a unique identifying number and not by name. When results become available, patients go the UCSD Treatment Center to learn the results and for post-test counseling.",Observational,"Inclusion Criteria

IL-2 is a protein found naturally in the blood that can help boost the immune system. HIV spreads throughout the body by invading CD4 cells, which are cells of the immune system that fight infection. Doctors hope that adding IL-2 to a current anti-HIV drug combination can help restore the CD4 cell count and the immune functions. This study will look at how the HIV virus acts during the early stages of HIV infection, how the immune system responds to HIV, and what impact early treatment with anti-HIV medications has on the course of HIV infection.","At the time of initial HIV infection, CD4 cells are susceptible to infection, and the virus infects many T cells during the first 4 to 6 weeks. Many of these infected cells subsequently maintain the virus in a latent state. Immune reconstitution with daily low-dose IL-2 therapy is intended to correct or improve the deficiency in CD4 cells, while maintaining a high frequency of CD8+ HIV-specific CTL and increasing natural killer (NK) cells. After a year of HAART plus IL-2, it may be possible to discontinue HAART while maintaining IL-2 stimulatory therapy, and the immune reactivity repaired and stimulated by IL-2 should be able to contain the virus and maintain latency.

Patients are randomized to add IL-2 to their current HAART regimen or simply to remain on their current HAART regimen. IL-2 therapy is initiated at Month 3 of HAART. IL-2 is injected subcutaneously daily for 9 months, in addition to HAART. After completion of this 1-year treatment period, patients are evaluated for discontinuation of HAART. Patients with a viral load below 50 copies/ml throughout HAART plus IL-2, a CD4 count of at least 500 cells/mm3, and no onset of opportunistic infections may have HAART discontinued and IL-2 continued as monotherapy for an additional 6 months. After completing 6 months of IL-2 monotherapy, eligible patients may have IL-2 therapy discontinued.",Interventional,"Inclusion Criteria
